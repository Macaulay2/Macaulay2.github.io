<p>
  We encourage the creation of packages that simplify non-trivial bodies of
  computational methods, likely to be of interest to a community of researchers.
  We will be glad to distribute such packages, submitted and duly checked and
  approved, with future releases of the Macaulay2 system.  The name of the
  package and functions in it should follow Macaulay2 naming conventions. To the
  extent possible they should make the purpose of the package clear to the casual
  browser.  In particular, we encourage explanatory naming of functions, even if
  the names are relatively long; the users can always create shortcuts or use
  dynamic completion or abbreviation completion in emacs to speed typing.
