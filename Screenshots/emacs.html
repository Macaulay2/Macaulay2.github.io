   The screenshot below shows a user entering <i>Macaulay 2</i> commands into a
   file whose contents are displayed in the upper emacs buffer, sending each
   line, when ready, to <i>Macaulay 2</i> in the lower buffer, with a single
   keystroke.  Ensure that the name of the file is of the
   form <tt>*.m2</tt>, split the screen into two panels with <tt>C-x 2</tt>,
   position the cursor on a line of text to send and press the function
   key <tt>f11</tt>.  Use <tt>C-x o</tt> to switch to the other panel when
   needed.
