<h2>Question 10</h2>

<p>
  XEmacs doesn't work with Macaulay 2.
</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>
  Try adding the following lines to your ~/.xemacs/init.el file.  (The last line loads the file
  that the M2 "setup()" and "setupEmacs()" commands create, so run that first.)  Let us know whether it works out!
</p>

<pre>
  (if (and (boundp 'xemacsp) xemacsp)
     (defun replace-regexp-in-string (regexp rep string)
        (replace-in-string string regexp rep)))
  (load "~/.emacs-Macaulay2" t)
</pre>
