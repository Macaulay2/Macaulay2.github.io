<h2>Question 7</h2>

<p>
      If I try to use <code><b>getPackage</b></code> to download and install a package that depends on another package that I've already installed, then when
      running the examples, the examples fail because that other package is not found on the path.
</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>
      The problem is that the examples are run in a new Macaulay 2 process with
      "-q" on the command line, directing it to ignore files in the user's
      Macaulay2 application directory, which is the place where that other
      package has been installed.  The solution method used
      for <a href="6.html">question 6</a> will not work here, because
      "getPackage" calls "installPackage" and doesn't know about the UserMode
      option.  

</p><p> One solution is to edit the
    file <code><b>/usr/share/Macaulay2/Core/m2/html.m2</b></code>,
    where <code><b>/usr</b></code> should be replaced, if necessary, by the
    path to the Macaulay2 files on your system.  In that file you will change
    the default value of the UserMode option to installPackage from false to
    true.  Find the following line:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
	  UserMode => false,
</code>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
... and change it to this:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
	  UserMode => true,
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  On linux systems where loaddata and dumpdata are working, you may wish to
  refresh the dumpdata file by running the following shell command.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
	  M2 --dumpdata
</code>
</pre>

To see whether, on your system, M2 tries to consult the dumpdata file, start M2 this way:

<pre>
<code>
	  M2 --notify
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  Another solution takes advantage of the fact that the current directory,
  "./", is on the path: ensure that you start up M2 in the directory where the
  source code for that other package has been installed.  The name of that
  directory varies, depending on the operating system, but can be obtained from
  Macaulay 2 as follows:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    i1 : applicationDirectory()|"local/"|LAYOUT#"packages"

    o1 = /home/25/dan/.Macaulay2/local/share/Macaulay2/
</code>
</pre>
