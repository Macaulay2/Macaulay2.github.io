<h2>Question 8</h2>

<p>
      If I try to use <code><b>getPackage</b></code> to download and install a package whose example code will not run correctly unless a configuration option
      is set correctly, the examples fail.
</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>
  First you must follow the instructions in <a href="7.html">answer 7</a> to
     change the default value of the UserMode option to installPackage from
     false to true.  Then after your first attempt to run getPackage fails, you
     may set the configuration options by editing the appropriate configuration
     file (which should be there).  Then re-run the getPackage command.
