<h2>Question 6</h2>

<p>
      If I try to use <code><b>installPackage</b></code> to install a package that depends on another package that I've already installed, then when
      running the examples, the examples fail because that other package is not found on the path.
</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>
      The problem is that the examples are run in a new Macaulay 2 process with
      "-q" on the command line, directing it to ignore files in the user's
      Macaulay2 application directory, which is the place where that other
      package has been installed.  The solution is to set the user mode option as in the following example.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    installPackage("Foo", UserMode => true)
</code>
</pre>
