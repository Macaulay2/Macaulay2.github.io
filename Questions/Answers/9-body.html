<h2>Question 9</h2>

<p>
  The Cygwin setup program fails to install Macaulay 2, complaining about the absence of the file setup.ini.sig.
</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>

  The problem is that the latest versions of setup.exe insist on a signature
  for the file setup.ini, and we can't produce such a signature.  We will work
  on getting Macaulay 2 to appear in the official and standard cygwin
  repositories.  Meanwhile, download the tar file.
