<h2>Question 3</h2>

<p>
On my machine, the function keys f11 and f12 are intercepted by the operating system, and emacs doesn't respond to them.
</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>
  You could bind those two functions to different key sequences by putting
  lines like this in your .emacs init file (in your home directory).
</p>

<pre>
 (global-set-key [ (control c) (m) ] 'M2)
 (global-set-key [ (control c) (c) ] 'M2-send-to-program)
</pre>

<p>
  Or you could bind them to different function keys like this:
</p>

<pre>
 (global-set-key [ f9 ] 'M2)
 (global-set-key [ f10 ] 'M2-send-to-program)
</pre>
