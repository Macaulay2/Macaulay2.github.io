<h2>Question 5</h2>

<p>
  The command for computing the image of a ring map is gone.
</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>
  It has been replaced by <tt>coimage</tt>, which is a more correct name for
  what it does.  After all, the answer is returned as a quotient ring of the
  source ring of the map, not as a subring of the target ring of the map.
  (Macaulay 2 doesn't implement the notion of subring.)
