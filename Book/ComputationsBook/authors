chapters:

	"Algorithms for the Toric Hilbert Scheme", by Mike Stillman, Bernd Sturmfels, Rekha Thomas
		Ready by September 8?
		Stillman might like to referee Eisenbud-Decker.

	"Computations over complete intersections", Luchezar Avramov, Dan Grayson
		There's a chance it'll be ready by Sept 11.
		Completely written, except for the final part about the computations.
		Lucho has to spend another day checking it over, and then the
		authors have to edit it, but Lucho is very busy teaching.

	"Macaulay 2 and the geometry of schemes", Gregory Smith, Bernd Sturmfels
		Chapter complete.

	"From enumerative geometry to solving systems of equations", Frank Sottile
		Has provided a final draft.  There are some things Dan should try to
		speed up : "it would be good for rudimentary real root counting and
		also the trace form (with signature!) to be implemented
		in Macaulay2, at least to some degree."

	"Explicit computations in characteristic zero with D-module theory", Uli Walther
		Has provided a final draft.  This involves Groebner bases in
		noncommutative rings (Weyl algebras), and ends up computing
		local cohomology and perhaps deRham cohomology.
		[Would be willing to referee Avramov/Grayson, Eisenbud, or Eisenbud/Decker.]

	"Sheaf algorithms using the exterior algebra", David Eisenbud and Wolfram Decker
		Final draft provided.
		About resolutions over exterior algebras and Beilinson's spectral sequence.

	"Using small fields to construct objects in algebraic geometry", 
		by Frank Schreyer and Fabio Tonoli.
		Final draft provided.  

        Serkan Hosten, "Computing with monomial ideals and Scarf complexes".  
		This would involve extremal behavior of Betti numbers.
		He fell ill last weekend.  We'll get it by Sep 11!
		It is going to be a nice chapter on monomial ideals.

	David Jorgensen, "Computing Support Varieties"
		We've invited him to submit his paper for consideration as a chapter,
		and he'll submit his paper by Sept 11.

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	we don't expect these chapters

	David A. Bayer
		Is willing to try to come up with a suitable topic.

	David Eisenbud
	       Is willing to write a chapter on "Jet spaces of algebraic
	       varieties".  It concerns whether higher jet spaces are 
	       irreducible, and is related to whether the singularities
	       are rational singularities.

        Sorin Popescu
		Is willing to write a chapter perhaps on secant varieties of
		canonically embedded curves, or graded Betti numbers of
		finite 	subsets of projective space (computation of the 
		canonical module, Gale transform).
