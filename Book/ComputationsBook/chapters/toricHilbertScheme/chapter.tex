\begin{abstract}
The toric Hilbert scheme parametrizes all algebras isomorphic to a
given semigroup algebra as a multigraded vector space. All components
of the scheme are toric varieties, and among them, there is a fairly
well understood coherent component. It is unknown whether
toric Hilbert schemes are always connected. In this chapter we
illustrate the use of \Mtwo for exploring the structure of toric
Hilbert schemes. In the process we will encounter algorithms from
commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, polyhedral theory and
geometric combinatorics.

\section*{Introduction}
Consider the multigrading of the polynomial ring $R =
\k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ specified by a non-negative integer $d \times
n$-matrix $A = (a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ such that degree $(x_i) = a_i \in
\N^d$. This defines a decomposition $\, R = \bigoplus_{b \in \N A} R_b
$, where $\N A$ is the subsemigroup of $\N^d$ spanned by
$a_1,\ldots,a_n$, and $R_b$ is the $\k$-span of all monomials $\, x^u
= x_1^{u_1}\cdots x_n^{u_n}$ with degree $Au = a_1 u_1 +\cdots + a_n
u_n = b$.  The {\it \ie{toric Hilbert scheme}} $\,Hilb_A 
\,$ parametrizes all $A$-homogeneous ideals $I \subset R$ (ideals that
are homogeneous under the multigrading of $R$ by $\N A$) with the
property that $(R/I)_b$ is a $1$-dimensional $\k$-vector space, for all
$b \in \N A$. We call such an ideal $I$ an $A$-{\em graded}\index{ideal!$A$-graded} ideal.
Equivalently, $I$ is $A$-graded if it is $A$-homogeneous and $R/I$ is
isomorphic as a multigraded vector space to the semigroup algebra $\,
\k [ \N A ] = R/I_A$, where $$I_A := \,\langle x^u - x^v \, : \, Au =
Av \rangle \subset R$$ is the {\it \ie{toric ideal}} of $A$. An $A$-graded
ideal is generated by binomials and monomials in $R$ since, by
definition, any two monomials $x^u$ and $x^v$ of the same degree $Au = 
Av$ must be $\k$-linearly dependent modulo the ideal.

We recommend \cite[\S 4, \S 10]{HS:St2} as an introductory reference for the 
topics in this chapter.
The study of toric Hilbert schemes for $d=1$ goes back to
Arnold \cite{HS:Arn} and Korkina et al.\cite{HS:KPR}, and it was
further developed by Sturmfels  (\cite{HS:St1} and \cite[\S 10]{HS:St2}). 
Peeva and Stillman \cite{HS:PS1} introduced the scheme structure 
that gives the toric Hilbert scheme its universal property,
and from this they derive a formula for the tangent space
of a point on  $\, Hilb_A $. Maclagan recently showed that the 
quadratic binomials in \cite[\S 5]{HS:St1} define the same scheme as the
determinantal equations in \cite{HS:PS1}.
Both of these systems of global equations are 
generally much too big for 
practical computations. Instead, most of our algorithms are based on
the local equations given by Peeva and Stillman in \cite{HS:PS2}
and the combinatorial approach of Maclagan and Thomas in \cite{HS:MT}.

We begin with the computation of a toric ideal using \Mtwo. Our
running example throughout this chapter is the following $2 \times
5$-matrix:
\begin{equation}
\label{OurMatrix}
A = \left( \begin{matrix}
           1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1  \\ 
           0 & 1 & 2 & 7 & 8 
\end{matrix} \right),
\end{equation}
which we input to \Mtwo as a list of lists of 
integers.
<<<A = {{1,1,1,1,1},{0,1,2,7,8}}; >>>
The toric ideal of $A$ lives in the multigraded ring $R := \k [a,b,c,d,e]$.
<<<R = QQ[a..e,Degrees=>transpose A]; >>>
<<<describe R >>>

We use Algorithm 12.3 in \cite{HS:St2} to compute $I_A$. The first step is
to find a matrix $B$ whose rows generate the lattice $ker_{\ZZ}(A)
:= \{x \in \ZZ^n : Ax = 0 \}$. 

<<<B = transpose syz matrix A >>>

Although in theory any basis of $ker_{\ZZ}(A)$ will suffice, in
practice it is more efficient to use a {\em reduced} basis
\cite[\S 6.2]{HS:Sch}, which can be computed using the {\em \ie{basis
reduction}} package {\tt LLL.m2} in \Mtwo. The command {\tt LLL} 
when applied to the output of {\tt syz matrix A} will return a 
matrix of the same size whose columns form a reduced lattice basis 
for $ker_{\ZZ}(A)$. The output appears in compressed form as follows:

<<<load "LLL.m2"; >>>
<<<LLL syz matrix A >>>

We recompute $B$ using this package to get the following $3 \times 5$ matrix.
<<<B = transpose LLL syz matrix A >>>

The advantage of a reduced basis may not be apparent in small
examples. However, as the size of $A$ increases, it becomes
increasingly important for the termination of Algorithm 12.3 in \cite{HS:St2}. (To
appreciate this, consider the matrix (\ref{non-normal}) from 
Section~4.)

A row $b = b^+ - b^-$ of $B$ is then coded as the binomial
$x^{b^+}-x^{b^-} \in R$, and we let $J$ be the ideal generated by all 
such binomials. 

<<<toBinomial = (b,R) -> (
     top := 1_R; bottom := 1_R;
     scan(#b, i -> if b_i > 0 then top = top * R_i^(b_i)
          else if b_i < 0 then bottom = bottom * R_i^(-b_i));
     top - bottom); >>>

<<<J = ideal apply(entries B, b -> toBinomial(b,R)) >>>
The toric ideal equals $(J : (x_1 \cdots x_n)^\infty)$, which is 
computed via $n$ successive saturations as follows:
<<<scan(gens ring J, f -> J = saturate(J,f))>>>

Putting the above pieces of code together, we get the following
procedure for computing the toric ideal of a matrix $A$.

<<<toricIdeal = (A) -> (
    n := #(A_0);  
    R = QQ[vars(0..n-1),Degrees=>transpose A,MonomialSize=>16]; 
    B := transpose LLL syz matrix A;
    J := ideal apply(entries B, b -> toBinomial(b,R));
    scan(gens ring J, f -> J = saturate(J,f));
    J
    ); >>>

See \cite{HS:BLR}, \cite{HS:HS} and \cite[\S 4, \S 12]{HS:St2} for other
algorithms for computing toric ideals and various ideas for
speeding up the computation.

In our example, $I_A = \langle
cd-be,bd-ae,b^2-ac,a^2d^2-c^3e,c^4-a^3e,bc^3-a^3d,
ad^4-c^2e^3,d^6-ce^5 \rangle$, which we now compute using this
procedure.  

<<<I = toricIdeal A; >>> 
<<<transpose mingens I>>>

This ideal defines an embedding of
$\P^1$ as a degree $8$ curve into $\P^4$. We will see in Section 3
that its toric Hilbert scheme $Hilb_A$ has a non-reduced component.

This chapter is organized into four sections and two appendices as
follows. The main goal in Section~1 is to describe an algorithm for
generating all monomial $A$-graded ideals for a given $A$. These
monomial ideals are the vertices of the {\em flip graph} of $A$ whose
connectivity is equivalent to the connectivity of $Hilb_A$. We
describe how all neighbors of a given vertex of this graph can be
calculated. In Section~2, we explain the role of polyhedral geometry
in the study of $Hilb_A$. Our first algorithm tests for {\em
coherence} in a monomial $A$-graded ideal. We then show how to compute
the polyhedral complexes supporting $A$-graded ideals, which in turn
relate the flip graph of $A$ to the {\em \ie{Baues graph}} of $A$.  For
unimodular matrices, these two graphs coincide and hence our method of
computing the flip graph can be used to compute the Baues
graph. Section~3 explores the components of $Hilb_A$ via local
equations around the torus fixed points of the scheme. We include a
combinatorial interpretation of these local equations from the point
of view of integer programming.  The scheme $Hilb_A$ has a {\em
coherent} component, which is examined in detail in Section~4. We prove
that this component is, in general, not normal and that its
normalization is the toric variety of the Gr\"obner fan of $I_A$. We
conclude the chapter with two appendices, each containing one large
piece of \Mtwo code that we use in this chapter. Appendix \ref{FMe} displays
code from the \Mtwo file {\tt polarCone.m2} that is used to convert a generator
representation of a polyhedron to an inequality representation and
vice versa. Appendix \ref{Mpor} displays code from the file {\tt minPres.m2} used for computing minimal
presentations of polynomial quotient rings. The main ingredient of
this package is the subroutine {\tt removeRedundantVariables}, which is
what we use in this chapter.

\section{Generating Monomial Ideals}
We start out by computing the {\it \ie{Graver basis}} $Gr_A$, which is the
set of binomials in $I_A$ that are minimal with respect to the
partial order defined by $$\, x^u - x^v \,\leq\, x^{u'} - x^{v'} \quad \iff
\quad \hbox{ $x^u$ divides $x^{u'}$ \ and \ $x^v$ divides $x^{v'}$.}
$$ The set $Gr_A$ is a {\em universal Gr\"obner basis}\index{Grobner basis@Gr\"obner basis!universal} of $I_A$ and
has its origins in the theory of integer programming \cite{HS:Gra}. It
can be computed using \cite[Algorithm 7.2]{HS:St2}, a \Mtwo version of
which is given below.

<<<graver = (I) -> (
    R := ring I;
    k := coefficientRing R;
    n := numgens R;
    -- construct new ring S with 2n variables
    S := k[Variables=>2*n,MonomialSize=>16];
    toS := map(S,R,(vars S)_{0..n-1});
    toR := map(R,S,vars R | matrix(R, {toList(n:1)}));
    -- embed I in S
    m := gens toS I;
    -- construct the toric ideal of the Lawrence 
    -- lifting of A
    i := 0;
    while i < n do (
        wts := join(toList(i:0),{1},toList(n-i-1:0));
        wts = join(wts,wts);
        m = homogenize(m,S_(n+i),wts);
        i=i+1;
        );
   J := ideal m;
   scan(gens ring J, f -> J = saturate(J,f));
   -- apply the map toR to the minimal generators of J 
   f := matrix entries toR mingens J;
   p := sortColumns f;
   f_p) ;  >>>
   
   The above piece of code first constructs a new polynomial ring $S$
   in $n$ more variables than $R$. Assume $S = \k [x_1, \ldots, x_n,
   y_1, \ldots, y_n]$. The inclusion map {\tt toS} $: R \rightarrow
   S$ embeds the toric ideal $I$ in $S$ and collects its generators in
   the matrix {\tt m}. A binomial $x^a - x^b$ lies in $Gr_A$ if and only
   if $x^ay^b-x^by^a$ is a minimal generator of the toric ideal in $S$
   of the $(d+n) \times 2n$ matrix $$\Lambda(A) := \left (
     \begin{array}{cc} A & 0 \\ I_n & I_n \end{array} \right),$$ which
   is called the {\em \ie{Lawrence lifting}} of $A$. Since $u \in
   ker_{\ZZ}(A) \Leftrightarrow (u,-u) \in ker_{\ZZ} (\Lambda(A))$, we
   use the {\tt while}\indexcmd{while} loop to homogenize the binomials in {\tt m} with
   respect to $\Lambda(A)$, using the $n$ new variables in $S$. This
   converts a binomial $x^a-x^b \in$ {\tt m} to the binomial
   $x^ay^b-x^by^a$.  The ideal generated by these new binomials is
   labeled $J$. As before, we can now successively saturate $J$
   to get the toric ideal of $\Lambda(A)$ in $S$. The image of the
   minimal generators of this toric ideal under the map {\tt toR}
   $: S \rightarrow R$ such that $x_i \mapsto x_i$ and $y_i \mapsto 1$
   is precisely the Graver basis $Gr_A$. These binomials are the
   entries of the matrix {\tt f} and is output by the program.

In our example $Gr_A$ consists of $42$ binomials.
<<<Graver = graver I >>> 

Returning to the general case, an element $b $ of $\N A$ is called a
{\it \ie{Graver degree}} if there exists a binomial $x^u - x^v$ in the
Graver basis $Gr_A$ such that $Au = Av = b$. If $b$ is a Graver degree
then the set of monomials in $R_b$ is the corresponding {\it \ie{Graver
  fiber}}.  In our running example there are $37$ distinct Graver
fibers. We define the {\tt ProductIdeal} of $A$ as $PI := 
\langle x^ax^b : x^a-x^b  \in Gr_A \rangle$. This ideal is contained in
every monomial ideal of $Hilb_A$ and hence no monomial in $PI$ can be
a standard monomial of a monomial $A$-graded ideal. Since our purpose
in constructing Graver fibers is to use them to 
generate all monomial $A$-graded ideals, we will be content with
listing just the monomials in each Graver fiber that do not lie in
$PI$.  Since $R$ is multigraded by $A$, we can obtain such a
presentation of a Graver fiber by simply asking for the basis of $R$
in degree $b$ modulo $PI$.  

<<<graverFibers = (Graver) -> (
     ProductIdeal := (I) -> ( trim ideal(
        apply(numgens I, a -> ( 
            f := I_a; leadTerm f * (leadTerm f - f))))); 
     PI := ProductIdeal ideal Graver; 
     R := ring Graver; 
     new HashTable from apply(
         unique degrees source Graver,
         d -> d => compress (basis(d,R) % PI) ));>>>

<<<fibers = graverFibers Graver >>>

For example, the Graver degree $(8,8)$ corresponds to the Graver fiber
$$ \bigl\{\,
\underline{a^7 e}, \, \underline{a^6 b d},\,  \underline{a^4 c^4}, \,
a^3 b^2 c^3,\, a^2 b^4 c^2,\,  a b^6 c, \, \underline{b^8} \,\bigr\}.$$
Our \Mtwo code outputs only the four underlined monomials,
in the format {\tt  | a7e a6bd a4c4 b8 |}. The three non-underlined 
monomials lie in the {\tt ProductIdeal}. Graver degrees are
important because of the following result.

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Lemma 10.5]{HS:St2}}]
The multidegree of any minimal generator of any ideal 
$I$ in $Hilb_A$ is a Graver degree.
\end{lemma}

The next step in constructing the toric Hilbert scheme is to compute
all its fixed points with respect to the scaling action of the
$n$-dimensional algebraic torus $(\k^*)^n$. (The torus $(\k^{\ast})^n$
acts on $R$ by scaling variables : $\lambda \mapsto \lambda \cdot x :=
(\lambda_1 x_1, \ldots, \lambda_n x_n)$.)  These fixed points are the
monomial ideals $M$ lying on $Hilb_A$.  Every term order $\prec$ on
the polynomial ring $R$ gives such a monomial ideal: $M = in_\prec(I_A
)$, the initial ideal of the toric ideal $I_A$ with respect to
$\prec$. Two ideals $J$ and $J'$ are said to be {\em torus
  isomorphic}\index{ideal!torus isomorphism}
if $J = \lambda \cdot J'$ for some $\lambda \in (\k^{\ast})^n$. Any
monomial $A$-graded ideal that is torus isomorphic to an initial ideal
of $I_A$ is said to be {\em coherent}\index{ideal!coherent}. In particular, the initial
ideals of $I_A$ are coherent and they can be computed by
\cite[Algorithm 3.6]{HS:St2} applied to $I_A$. A refinement and fast
implementation can be found in the software package {\tt TiGERS} by
Huber and Thomas \cite{HS:HT}.

Now we wish to compute all monomial ideals $M$ on $Hilb_A$ regardless
of whether $M$ is coherent or not. For this we use the procedure
{\tt generateAmonos} given below. This procedure takes in the Graver
basis $Gr_A$ and records the numerator of the Hilbert series of $I_A$
in {\tt trueHS}. It then computes the Graver fibers of $A$, sorts them
and calls the subroutine {\tt selectStandard} to generate a
candidate for a monomial ideal on $Hilb_A$.

<<<generateAmonos = (Graver) -> (
     trueHS := poincare coker Graver;
     fibers := graverFibers Graver;
     fibers = apply(sort pairs fibers, last);
     monos = {};
     selectStandard := (fibers, J) -> (
     if #fibers == 0 then (
        if trueHS == poincare coker gens J
        then (monos = append(monos,flatten entries mingens J));
     ) else (
        P := fibers_0;
        fibers = drop(fibers,1);
        P = compress(P % J);
        nP := numgens source P; 
        -- nP is the number of monomials not in J.
        if nP > 0 then (
           if nP == 1 then selectStandard(fibers,J)
           else (--remove one monomial from P,take the rest.
                 P = flatten entries P;
                 scan(#P, i -> (
                      J1 := J + ideal drop(P,{i,i});
                      selectStandard(fibers, J1)))));
     ));
     selectStandard(fibers, ideal(0_(ring Graver)));
     ) ; >>>

The arguments to the subroutine {\tt selectStandard}
are the Graver fibers given as a list of matrices and a monomial 
ideal $J$ that should be included in every $A$-graded ideal 
that we generate. The subroutine then loops through each Graver fiber, 
and at each step selects a standard monomial from that fiber and 
updates the ideal $J$ by adding the other monomials in this fiber 
to $J$. The final $J$ output by the subroutine is the candidate ideal
that is sent back to {\tt generateAmonos}. It is stored by the program 
if its Hilbert series agrees with that of $I_A$. 
All the monomial $A$-graded ideals are stored in the list {\tt monos}.
Below, we ask \Mtwo for the cardinality of {\tt monos} and its 
first ten elements.
<<<generateAmonos Graver;>>>
<<<#monos >>>
<<<scan(0..9, i -> print toString monos#i) >>>

The monomial ideals (torus-fixed points) on $Hilb_A$ form the vertices
of the {\it \ie{flip graph}} of $A$ whose edges correspond to the
torus-fixed curves on $Hilb_A$. This graph was introduced in \cite{HS:MT}
and provides structural information about $Hilb_A$.  The edges
emanating from a monomial ideal $M$ can be constructed as follows: 
For any minimal generator $x^u$ of $M$, let $x^v$ be the unique
monomial with $x^v \not\in M$ and $Au = Av$. Form the {\it \ie{wall ideal}},
which is generated by $x^u - x^v$ and all minimal generators of $M$
other than $x^u$, and let $M'$ be the initial monomial ideal of the
wall ideal with respect to any term order $\succ$ for which $x^v \succ
x^u$. It can be shown that $M'$ is the unique initial monomial ideal
of the wall ideal that contains $x^v$.  If $M'$ lies on $Hilb_A$ then
$\{M, M'\}$ is an edge of the flip graph. We now illustrate the \Mtwo
procedure for computing all flip neighbors of a monomial $A$-graded
ideal.
 
<<<findPositiveVector = (m,s) -> (
     expvector := first exponents s - first exponents m;
     n := #expvector;
     i := first positions(0..n-1, j -> expvector_j > 0);
     splice {i:0, 1, (n-i-1):0}
     );>>>

<<<flips = (M) -> (
     R := ring M;
     -- store generators of M in monoms
     monoms := first entries generators M;
     result := {};
     -- test each generator of M to see if it leads to a neighbor 
     scan(#monoms, i -> (
       m := monoms_i;
       rest := drop(monoms,{i,i});
       b := basis(degree m, R);
       s := (compress (b % M))_(0,0);
       J := ideal(m-s) + ideal rest;
       if poincare coker gens J == poincare coker gens M then (
         w := findPositiveVector(m,s);
         R1 := (coefficientRing R)[generators R, Weights=>w];
         J = substitute(J,R1);
         J = trim ideal leadTerm J;
         result = append(result,J);
         )));
     result
);>>>

The code above inputs a monomial $A$-graded ideal $M$ whose minimal
generators are stored in the list {\tt monoms}. The flip neighbors of
$M$ will be stored in {\tt result}. For each monomial $x^u$ in {\tt
monoms} we need to test whether it yields a flip neighbor of $M$ or
not. At the $i$-th step of this loop, we let {\tt m} be the $i$-th
monomial in {\tt monoms}. The list {\tt rest} contains all monomials
in {\tt monoms} except {\tt m}. We compute the standard monomial {\tt
s} of $M$ of the same degree as $m$.  The wall ideal of $m-s$ is the
binomial ideal $J$ generated by $m-s$ and the monomials in {\tt
rest}. We then check whether $J$ is $A$-graded by comparing its
Hilbert series with that of $M$. (Alternately, one could check whether
$M$ is the initial ideal of the wall ideal with respect to $m \succ
s$.) If this is the case, we use the subroutine {\tt
findPositiveVector} to find a unit vector $w = (0,\ldots,1,\ldots,0)$
such that $w \cdot s > w \cdot m$. The flip neighbor is then the
initial ideal of $J$ with respect to $w$ and it is stored in {\tt
result}. The program outputs the minimal generators of each flip
neighbor. Here is an example.
 
<<<R = QQ[a..e,Degrees=>transpose A];>>>
<<<M = ideal(a*e,c*d,a*c,a^2*d^2,a^2*b*d,a^3*d,c^2*e^3,
          c^3*e^2,c^4*e,c^5,c*e^5,a*d^5,b*e^6);>>>
<<<F = flips M>>>
<<<#F>>>
<<<scan(#F, i -> print toString entries mingens F_i)>>>

It is an open problem whether the toric Hilbert scheme $Hilb_A$ is
connected. Recent work in geometric combinatorics \cite{HS:San} suggests
that this is probably false for some $A$. This result and its 
implications for $Hilb_A$ will be discussed further in Section 2.
The following theorem of Maclagan and Thomas \cite{HS:MT} reduces the  
connectivity of $Hilb_A$ to a combinatorial problem.

\begin{theorem} 
The toric Hilbert scheme $Hilb_A$ is connected if and only if the 
flip graph of $A$ is connected.
\end{theorem}

We now have two algorithms for listing monomial ideals on $Hilb_A$.
First, there is the {\it \ie{backtracking algorithm}} whose \Mtwo
implementation was described above.  Second, there is the {\it \ie{flip
  search algorithm}}, which starts with any coherent monomial ideal $M$
and then constructs the connected component of $M$ in the flip graph
of $A$ by carrying out local flips as above.  This procedure is also 
implemented in {\tt TiGERS} \cite{HS:HT}. Clearly, the two algorithms
will produce the same answer if and only if $Hilb_A$ is connected. In
other words, finding an example where $Hilb_A$ is disconnected is
equivalent to finding a matrix $A$ for which the flip search algorithm
produces fewer monomial ideals than the backtracking algorithm.

\section{Polyhedral Geometry}

Algorithms from polyhedral geometry are essential in the study of the
toric Hilbert scheme. Consider the problem of deciding whether or not
a given monomial ideal $M$ in $Hilb_A$ is coherent.  This problem
gives rise to a system of linear inequalities as follows: Let
$x^{u_1}, \ldots, x^{u_r}$ be the minimal generators of $M$, and let
$x^{v_i}$ be the unique standard monomial with $A u_i = A v_i$. Then
$M$ is coherent if and only if there exists a vector $w \in \R^n$ such
that $\,w \cdot (u_i - v_i) > 0\,$ for $i =1,\ldots,r$.  Thus the test
for coherence amounts to solving a {\sl feasibility problem of linear
programming}, and there are many highly efficient algorithms (based on
the simplex algorithms or interior point methods) available for this
task. For our experimental purposes, it is convenient to use the code
{\tt polarCone.m2}, given in Appendix \ref{FMe}, which is based on the
(inefficient but easy-to-implement) {\em \ie{Fourier-Motzkin elimination}}
method (see \cite{HS:Zie} for a description).  This code converts the
generator representation of a polyhedron to its inequality
representation and vice versa. A simple example is given in Appendix
\ref{FMe}. In particular, given a Gr\"obner basis $\mathcal G$ of $I_A$, the
function {\tt polarCone} will compute all the extreme rays of the {\em
Gr\"obner cone\index{Grobner cone@Gr\"obner cone}} $\,\{ w \in \R^n \,: \,w \cdot (u_i - v_i) \geq 0\,$
for each $x^{u_i}-x^{v_i} \in {\mathcal G}\}.$

We now show how to use \Mtwo to decide whether a 
monomial $A$-graded ideal $M$ is coherent. The first step in 
this calculation is to compute all the standard monomials of $M$ 
of the same degree as the minimal generators of $M$. We do this 
using the procedure {\tt stdMonomials}.

<<<stdMonomials = (M) -> (
     R := ring M;
     RM := R/M;
     apply(numgens M, i -> (
           s := basis(degree(M_i),RM); lift(s_(0,0), R)))
     ); >>>

As an example, consider the following monomial $A$-graded ideal.

<<<R = QQ[a..e,Degrees => transpose A ]; >>>
<<<M = ideal(a^3*d, a^2*b*d, a^2*d^2, a*b^3*d, a*b^2*d^2, a*b*d^3, 
          a*c, a*d^4, a*e, b^5*d, b^4*d^2, b^3*d^3, b^2*d^4, 
          b*d^5, b*e, c*e^5); >>>
<<<toString stdMonomials M >>>

From the pairs $x^u,x^v$ of minimal generators $x^u$ and
the corresponding standard monomials $x^v$, the function {\tt inequalities}
creates a matrix whose columns are the vectors $u-v$. 

<<<inequalities = (M) -> (
        stds := stdMonomials(M);
        transpose matrix apply(numgens M, i -> (
            flatten exponents(M_i) - 
                flatten exponents(stds_i)))); >>>
<<<inequalities M>>>

It is convenient to simplify the output of the next procedure 
using the following program to divide an integer vector 
by the g.c.d. of its components. We also load {\tt polarCone.m2},
which is needed in {\tt decideCoherence} below.

<<<primitive := (L) -> (
     n := #L-1; g := L#n;
     while n > 0 do (n = n-1; g = gcd(g, L#n););
     if g === 1 then L else apply(L, i -> i // g));>>>

<<<load "polarCone.m2" >>>

<<<decideCoherence = (M) -> (
     ineqs := inequalities M;
     c := first polarCone ineqs;
     m := - sum(numgens source c, i -> c_{i});
     prods := (transpose m) * ineqs;
     if numgens source prods != numgens source compress prods
     then false else primitive (first entries transpose m)); >>>
 
Let $K$ be the cone $\{x \in {\mathbb R}^n : g \cdot x \leq 0$,
for all columns $g$ of {\tt ineqs} \}. The command {\tt
polarCone ineqs} computes a pair of matrices $P$ and $Q$ such
that $K$ is the sum of the cone generated by the columns of $P$
and the subspace generated by the columns of $Q$. Let {\tt m} be
the negative of the sum of the columns of $P$. Then {\tt m} lies
in the cone $-K$. The entries in the matrix {\tt prods} are the
dot products $g \cdot m$ for each column $g$ of {\tt ineqs}.
Since $M$ is a monomial $A$-graded ideal, it is coherent if and
only if $K$ is full dimensional, which is the case if and only if
no dot product $g \cdot m$ is zero. This is the conditional in
the {\tt if .. then} statement of {\tt decideCoherence}. If $M$
is coherent, the program outputs the primitive representative of
{\tt m} and otherwise returns the boolean {\tt false}. Notice that 
if $M$ is coherent, the cone $-K$ is the Gr\"obner cone corresponding 
to $M$ and the vector {\tt m} is a weight vector $w$ such that
$in_w(I_A) = M$. We now test whether the ideal $M$ from 
line {\tt i29} is coherent.

<<<decideCoherence M>>>

Hence, $M$ is coherent: it is the initial ideal with respect to the 
weight vector $w = (0,0,1,15,18)$ of the toric ideal in our running
example (\ref{OurMatrix}). Here is one of the 55 noncoherent
monomial $A$-graded ideals of this matrix.

<<<N = ideal(a*e,c*d,a*c,c^3*e,a^3*d,c^4,a*d^4,a^2*d^3,c*e^5,
           c^2*e^4,d^7);>>>
<<<decideCoherence N>>>

In the rest of this section, we study the connection between
$A$-graded ideals and polyhedral complexes defined on $A$.  This study
relates the flip graph of the toric Hilbert scheme to the Baues
graph of the configuration $A$.                  (See \cite{HS:Reiner} for a
survey of the Baues problem and its relatives).  Let $pos(A) := \{ Au
: u \in \R^n, u \geq 0 \}$ be the cone generated by the columns of $A$
in $\R^d$. A {\em \ie{polyhedral subdivision}} $\Delta$ of $A$ is a
collection of full dimensional subcones $pos(A_{\sigma})$ of $pos(A)$
such that the union of these subcones is $pos(A)$ and the intersection
of any two subcones is a face of each.  Here $A_{\sigma} := \{a_j : j
\in \sigma \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\} \}$.  It is customary to identify 
$\Delta$ with the set of sets $\{ \sigma : pos(A_{\sigma}) \in \Delta
\}$. If every cone in the 
subdivision $\Delta$ is simplicial (the number of extreme rays of the
cone equals the dimension of the cone), we say that $\Delta$ is a {\em
  \ie{triangulation}} of $A$. The simplicial complex corresponding
to a triangulation $\Delta$ is uniquely obtained by including in
$\Delta$ all the subsets of every $\sigma \in \Delta$. We refer the
reader to \cite[\S 8]{HS:St2} for more details.

For each $\sigma \in \Delta$, let $I_{\sigma}$ be the prime ideal 
that is the sum of the toric ideal $I_{A_{\sigma}}$ and the monomial 
ideal $\langle x_j :j \not \in \sigma \rangle$. Recall that two
ideals $J$ and $J'$ are said to be 
{\em torus isomorphic} if $J = \lambda \cdot J'$ for some $\lambda \in 
(\k^{\ast})^n$. The following theorem shows that polyhedral
subdivisions of $A$ are related to $A$-graded ideals via their 
radicals.

\begin{theorem}[Theorem~10.10 {\cite[\S 10]{HS:St2}}]\label{polysubdivisions}
  If $I$ is an $A$-graded ideal, then there exists a polyhedral
  subdivision $\Delta(I)$ of $A$ such that $\sqrt{I} = \cap_{\sigma
    \in \Delta(I)} J_{\sigma}$ where each component $J_{\sigma}$ is a
  prime ideal that is torus isomorphic to $I_{\sigma}$.
\end{theorem}

We say that $\Delta(I)$ supports the $A$-graded ideal $I$.
When $M$ is a monomial $A$-graded ideal, $\Delta(M)$ is a 
triangulation of $A$. In particular, if $M$ is coherent (i.e, $M =
in_w(I_A)$ for some weight vector $w$), then $\Delta(M)$ is the {\em
  regular} or {\em coherent} triangulation\index{triangulation!regular} of $A$ induced by $w$
\cite[\S 8]{HS:St2}. The coherent triangulations of $A$ are in bijection
with the vertices of the {\em \ie{secondary polytope}} of $A$ \cite{HS:BFS},
\cite{HS:GKZ}.  

It is convenient to represent a triangulation $\Delta$ of $A$ by its 
{\em Stanley-Reisner} ideal\index{Stanley-Reisner ideal} $I_{\Delta} := \langle x_{i_1}x_{i_2}
\cdots x_{i_k} : \{ i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k \}$ is a non-face of  
$\Delta \rangle$. If $M$ is a monomial $A$-graded ideal,
Theorem~\ref{polysubdivisions} implies that $I_{\Delta(M)}$ is the 
radical of $M$. Hence we will represent triangulations 
of $A$ by their Stanley-Reisner ideals. As seen below, the matrix in
our running example has eight distinct triangulations 
corresponding to the eight distinct radicals of the 281 monomial 
$A$-graded ideals computed earlier. All eight are coherent.

The Baues graph of $A$ is a graph on all the triangulations of
$A$ in which two triangulations are adjacent if they differ by a
single {\em \ie{bistellar flip}} \cite{HS:Reiner}. The {\em \ie{Baues problem}} from
discrete geometry asked whether the Baues graph of a point
configuration can be disconnected for some $A$. Every edge of the
secondary polytope of $A$ corresponds to a bistellar flip, and hence
the subgraph of the Baues graph that is induced by the coherent
triangulations of $A$ is indeed connected: it is precisely the edge
graph of the secondary polytope of $A$.  The Baues problem was
recently settled by Santos \cite{HS:San} who gave an example of a six
dimensional point configuration with $324$ points for which there is
an isolated (necessarily non-regular) triangulation.

Santos' configuration would also have a disconnected flip graph and hence
a disconnected toric Hilbert scheme if it were true that {\em every} 
triangulation of $A$ supports a monomial $A$-graded
ideal. However, Peeva has shown that this need not be the case
(Theorem~10.13 in \cite[\S 10]{HS:St2}). Hence, the map from the set of
all monomial $A$-graded ideals to the set of all triangulations of
$A$ that sends $M \mapsto \Delta(M)$ is not always
surjective, and it is unknown whether Santos' $6 \times 324$ 
configuration has a disconnected toric Hilbert scheme.  

Thus, even though one cannot in general conclude that the existence of
a disconnected Baues graph implies the existence of a disconnected
flip graph, there is an important special situation in which such a
conclusion is possible. We call an integer matrix $A$ of full row rank
{\em unimodular}\index{matrix!unimodular} if the absolute value of each of its non-zero maximal
minors is the same constant. A matrix $A$ is unimodular if and only if
every monomial $A$-graded ideal is square-free. For a unimodular
matrix $A$, the Baues graph of $A$ coincides with the flip graph of
$A$. As you might expect, Santos' configuration is not unimodular.

\begin{theorem}[Lemma~10.14 {\cite[\S 10]{HS:St2}}]\label{unimodular}
If $A$ is unimodular, then each triangulation of $A$ supports a unique
(square-free) monomial $A$-graded ideal. In this case, a monomial
$A$-graded ideal is coherent if and only if the triangulation
supporting it is coherent.
\end{theorem}

Using Theorem~\ref{unimodular} we can compute all the triangulations
of a unimodular matrix since they are precisely the polyhedral
complexes supporting monomial $A$-graded ideals. Then we could
enumerate the connected component of a coherent monomial $A$-graded
ideal in the flip graph of $A$ to decide whether the Baues/flip graph
is disconnected.

Let $\Delta_r$ be the standard $r$-simplex that 
is the convex hull of the $r+1$ unit vectors in $\R^{r+1}$, and let 
$A(r,s)$ be the $(r+s+2) \times (r+1)(s+1)$ matrix whose columns 
are the products of the vertices of $\Delta_r$ and $\Delta_s$. All 
matrices of type $A(r,s)$ are unimodular. From the
product of two triangles we get $$A(2,2) := 
\left ( \begin{array}{ccccccccc}
1&1&1&0&0&0&0&0&0\\
0&0&0&1&1&1&0&0&0\\
0&0&0&0&0&0&1&1&1\\
1&0&0&1&0&0&1&0&0\\
0&1&0&0&1&0&0&1&0\\
0&0&1&0&0&1&0&0&1 \end{array} \right ).$$
We can now use our algebraic algorithms to compute all
the triangulations of $A(2,2)$. Since \Mtwo requires the first entry 
of the degree of every variable in a ring to be positive, we use 
the following matrix with the same row space as $A(2,2)$ for our 
computation:

<<<A22 =
  {{1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1},{0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0},{0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1},
  {1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0},{0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0},{0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1}}; >>>
<<<I22 = toricIdeal A22>>>
The ideal {\tt I22} is generated by the 2 by 2 minors of a 3 by 3
matrix of indeterminates.  This is the ideal of $\P^2 \times \P^2$
embedded in $\P^8$ via the Segre embedding.
<<<Graver22 = graver I22;>>>
<<<generateAmonos(Graver22);>>>
<<<#monos>>>
<<<scan(0..9,i->print toString monos#i) >>>

Thus there are 108 monomial $A(2,2)$-graded ideals and 
{\tt decideCoherence} will check that all of them 
are coherent. Since $A(2,2)$ is unimodular, each monomial 
$A(2,2)$-graded ideal is square-free and is hence 
radical. These 108 ideals represent the 108 triangulations of 
$A(2,2)$ and we have listed ten of them above.
The flip graph (equivalently, Baues graph) of $A(2,2)$ is connected.
However, it is unknown whether the Baues graph of $A(r,s)$ is 
connected for all values of $(r,s)$.

\section{Local Equations}
Consider the reduced Gr\"obner basis of a toric ideal $I_A$ for a
term order $w$:
\begin{equation}
\label{GrobnerBasis} \bigl\{ \,
 x^{u_1} -  x^{v_1} \, , \,\, x^{u_2} -  x^{v_2} \,, \,\, \ldots \, , \,\,
x^{u_r} -  x^{v_r}\, \bigr\} .
\end{equation}
The initial ideal $\,M = in_w(I_A) = \langle x^{u_1}, x^{u_2}, \ldots,
x^{u_r} \rangle \,$ is a coherent monomial $A$-graded ideal. In
particular, it is a $(\k^*)^n$-fixed point on the toric Hilbert scheme
$Hilb_A$.  We shall explain a method, due to Peeva and Stillman
\cite{HS:PS2}, for computing local equations of $Hilb_A$ around such a
fixed point.  A variant of this method also works for computing the
local equations around a non-coherent monomial ideal $M$, but that
variant involves local algebra, specifically Mora's tangent cone
algorithm, which is not yet fully implemented in \Mtwo. See \cite{HS:PS2}
for details.

We saw how to compute the flip graph of $A$ in Section~1. The vertices
of this graph are the $(\k^*)^n$-fixed points $M$ and its edges
correspond to the $(\k^*)^n$-fixed curves.  By computing and
decomposing the local equations around each $M$, we get a complete
description of the scheme $Hilb_A$.

The first step is to introduce a new variable $ \, z_i \,$ for each 
binomial in our Gr\"obner basis (\ref{GrobnerBasis}) and to consider 
the following $r$ binomials:
\begin{equation}
\label{FlatFamily}
 x^{u_1} -  z_1 \cdot x^{v_1} \,, \,\,
 x^{u_2} - z_2  \cdot x^{v_2} \,,\, \, \ldots \, ,
\,\, x^{u_r} -   z_r \cdot x^{v_r} 
\end{equation}
in the polynomial ring $\k[x,z]$ in  $n+r$ indeterminates.
The term order $w$ can be extended to an elimination term order
in $\k[x,z]$ so that $x^{u_i}$ is the leading term of
$ x^{u_i} -  z_i \cdot x^{v_i} $ for all $i$. 
We compute the minimal first syzygies
of the monomial ideal $M$, and form the
corresponding $S$-pairs of binomials in (\ref{FlatFamily}).
For each $S$-pair
$$
\frac{lcm(x^{u_i},x^{u_j})}{x^{u_i}} \cdot (x^{u_i} - z_i \cdot
x^{v_i} ) \,\,\, - \,\,\, \frac{lcm(x^{u_i},x^{u_j})}{x^{u_j}} \cdot
(x^{u_j} - z_j \cdot x^{v_j}) $$
we compute a normal form with respect
to (\ref{FlatFamily}) using the extended term order $w$.  The result
is a binomial in $\k[x,z]$ that factors as 
$$  x^\alpha \cdot z^\beta \cdot  ( z^\gamma - z^\delta ) , $$
where $\alpha \in \N^n$ and $\beta,\gamma,\delta \in \N^r$.
Note that this normal form is not unique but depends on our
choice of a reduction path.
Let $J_M$ denote the ideal in $\k[z_1 , \ldots, z_r]$ generated by all 
binomials $\, z^\beta \cdot  ( z^\gamma - z^\delta ) \,$
gotten from normal forms of all the $S$-pairs considered above.

\begin{proposition}[\cite{HS:PS2}]\label{localeqns}
The ideal $J_M$ is independent of the reduction paths chosen.
It defines a subscheme of $\k^r$ isomorphic to
an affine open neighborhood of the point $M$ on 
the toric Hilbert scheme $Hilb_A$.
\end{proposition}

We apply this technique to compute a particularly interesting affine
chart of $Hilb_A$ for our running example.
Consider the following set of $13$ binomials:
\begin{eqnarray*}
& \bigl\{ \,a e - z_1 b d ,  \,
 c d - z_2 b e , \,
 a c - z_3 b^2 , \,
 a^2 d^2 - z_4 c^3 e , \,
 a^2 b d - z_5 c^4 , \\ &
 a^3 d - z_6 b c^3 , \,
 c^2 e^3 - z_7 a d^4 , \, 
 c^3 e^2 - z_8 a b d^3 , \,
 c^4 e - z_9 a b^2 d^2 , \\ &
 c^5 - z_{10} a b^3 d , \,
 c e^5 - z_{11} d^6 , \,
 a d^5 - z_{12} b c e^4 , \,
 b e^6 - z_{13} d^7  \, \bigr\}.
\end{eqnarray*}
If we set $\, z_1 = z_2 = \cdots = z_{13} = 1\,$
then we get a generating set for the toric ideal $I_A$.
The $13$ monomials obtained by setting
$\, z_1 = z_2 = \cdots = z_{13} = 0 \,$
generate the initial monomial ideal $ M = in_w (I_A)$
with respect to the weight vector $w = (9, 3, 5, 0, 0)$.
Thus $M$ is one of the $226$ coherent monomial 
$A$-graded ideals of our running example. The above set of 
13 binomials in $\k[x,z]$ give the universal family 
for $Hilb_A$ around this $M$.

The local chart of $Hilb_A$ around the point $M$
is a subscheme of affine space $\k^{13}$ with coordinates 
$z_1, \ldots, z_{13}$, whose
defining equations are obtained as follows: 
Extend the weight vector $w$ by assigning
weight zero to all variables $z_i$, so that
the first term in each of the above $13$ binomials
is the leading term. For each pair of binomials corresponding to a  
minimal syzygy of $M$, form their $S$-pair and then reduce it to a 
normal form with respect to the $13$ binomials above.
For instance,
$$
S \bigl(
 c^5 - z_{10} a b^3 d , 
 c e^5 - z_{11} d^6 \bigr)
\, = \,
 z_{11} c^4 d^6  - z_{10} a b^3 d e^5
\, \longrightarrow \,
b^4 d^2 e^4 \cdot (z_2^4 z_{11} - z_1 z_{10}).
$$
Each such normal form is a monomial in $a,b,c,d,e$ times a binomial in
$z_1, \ldots, z_{13}$.  The set of all these binomials, in the
$z$-variables, generates the ideal $J_M$ of local equations of
$Hilb_A$ around $M$.  In our example, $J_M$ is generated by $27$
nonzero binomials.  This computation can be done in \Mtwo using the
procedure {\tt localCoherentEquations}.

<<<localCoherentEquations = (IA) -> (

     Ihilb := ideal Fones (spairs % g);
     Ihilb
     );>>> 
     
Suppose we wish to calculate the local equations about $M =
in_w(I_A)$.  The input to {\tt localCoherentEquations} is the
toric ideal $I_A$ living in a polynomial ring equipped with the 
weight order specified by $w$. This is done as follows:

<<<IA = toricIdeal A;>>>
<<<Y = QQ[a..e, MonomialSize => 16,
            Degrees => transpose A, Weights => {9,3,5,0,0}];>>>
<<<IA = substitute(IA,Y);>>>

The initial ideal $M$ is calculated in the third line of the
algorithm, and {\tt S} stores the standard monomials of $M$ of the
same degrees as the minimal generators of $M$. We could have
calculated {\tt S} using our old procedure {\tt stdMonomials} but this
involves computing the monomials in $R_b$ for various values of $b$,
which can be slow on large examples. As by-products, {\tt
  localCoherentEquations} also gets {\tt J}, the ideal of the
universal family for $Hilb_A$ about $M$, the ring {\tt T} of this
ideal, and the ring {\tt B} of {\tt Ihilb}, which is the ideal of the
affine patch of $Hilb_A$ about $M$. The matrix {\tt spairs} contains
all the $S$-pairs between generators of {\tt J} corresponding to the
minimal first syzygies of $M$. The command {\tt forceGB} is used to
declare the generators of {\tt J} to be a Gr\"obner basis, and {\tt
  Fones} is the ring map from {\tt T} to {\tt B} that sends each of
$a,b,c,d,e$ to one and the $z$ variables to themselves.  The columns
of the matrix {\tt (spairs \% g)} are the normal forms of the
polynomials in {\tt spairs} with respect to the forced Gr\"obner basis
{\tt g} and the ideal {\tt Ihilb} of local equations is generated by
the image of these normal forms in the ring {\tt B} under the map {\tt
  Fones}.

Notice that there are many generators of $J_M$ that have a single
variable as one of its terms. Using these generators we can remove
variables from other binomials. This is done in \Mtwo using the
subroutine {\tt removeRedundantVariables}, which is the main ingredient
of the package {\tt minPres.m2} for computing the minimal
presentations of polynomial quotient rings. Both {\tt
  removeRedundantVariables} and {\tt minPres.m2} are explained in
Appendix \ref{Mpor}. The command {\tt removeRedundantVariables} applied to an
ideal in a polynomial ring (not quotient ring) creates a ring map from
the ring to itself that sends the redundant variables to polynomials 
in the non-redundant variables and the non-redundant variables to 
themselves. Applying this to our ideal $J_M$ we obtain the following 
simplifications.

Thus our affine patch of $Hilb_A$ has the coordinate ring 
$$\k[z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_{13}]/J_M \,\, \simeq \,\,

{\langle (z_5 z_{10}^2 -z_{13}) z_{10}z_{11}^2 \rangle}.$$
Hence, we see immediately that there are three
components through the point $M$ on $Hilb_A$. The restriction of the
coherent component to the affine neighborhood of $M$ on $Hilb_A$ is
defined by the ideal quotient $\, (J_M : (z_1 z_2 \cdots
z_{13})^\infty) $ and hence the first of the above components 
is an affine patch of the coherent component. Locally near $M$ it is  
given by the single equation $z_5 z_{10}^2 - z_{13} = 0$ in $\A^4$. 
It is smooth and, as expected, has dimension three. The second
component, $z_{10} = 0$, is also of dimension three and is smooth at $M$.
The third component, given by $z_{11}^2 = 0$ is more interesting.  It
has dimension three as well, but is not reduced.  Thus we have proved
the following result.

\begin{proposition}
The toric Hilbert scheme $Hilb_A$ of the matrix 
$$A = \left( \begin{matrix}
           1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1  \\ 
           0 & 1 & 2 & 7 & 8 
\end{matrix} \right)$$
is not reduced.
\end{proposition}

We can use the ring map {\tt G} from above to simplify {\tt J} so as
to involve only the four variables $z_5, z_{10},z_{11}$ and $z_{13}$.

<<<CX = QQ[a..e, z_5,z_10,z_11,z_13, Weights =>
      {9,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,0}];>>> 
<<<F = map(CX, ring J, matrix{{a,b,c,d,e}} | 
            substitute(G.matrix,CX))>>>
Applying this map to {\tt J} we get the ideal {\tt J1}, 
<<<J1 = F J>>>

\noindent and adding the ideal $\langle z_{11}^2 \rangle$ to {\tt J1} 
we obtain the universal family for the non-reduced component of
$Hilb_A$ about $M$. 

<<<substitute(ideal(z_11^2),CX) + J1>>>

In the rest of this section, we present an interpretation of
the ideal $J_M$ in terms of the combinatorial theory
of {\it \ie{integer programming}}. See, for instance, 
\cite[\S 4]{HS:St2} or \cite{HS:Tho} for 
the relevant background. Our reduced Gr\"obner basis 
(\ref{GrobnerBasis}) is the {\it \ie{minimal test set}} for
the family of integer programs
\begin{equation}
\label{IP}
{\rm Minimize} \quad
w \cdot u \,\,\quad
{\rm subject} \,\, {\rm to } \,\,\,
A \cdot u = b   \,\,\, {\rm and}
 \,\,\,u \in \N^n, 
\end{equation}
where $A \in \N^{d \times n}$ and $w
\in \ZZ^n$ are fixed and $b$ ranges over $\N^d$.
If $u' \in \N^n$ is any feasible solution
to (\ref{IP}), then the corresponding optimal solution
$u \in \N^n$ is computed as follows: the monomial
$x^u $ is the unique normal form of $x^{u'}$ modulo
the Gr\"obner basis (\ref{GrobnerBasis}).

Suppose we had reduced $x^{u'}$
modulo the binomials (\ref{FlatFamily}) instead of (\ref{GrobnerBasis}).
Then the output has a $z$-factor that depends on 
our choice of reduction path. To be precise, suppose the
reduction path has length $m$ and at the $j$-th step we had used the
reduction $\, x^{u_{\mu_j}} \rightarrow  z_{\mu_j} \cdot x^{v_{\mu_j}}
$. Then we would obtain the normal form
$$ \, z_{\mu_1} z_{\mu_2} z_{\mu_3} \cdots z_{\mu_m} \cdot x^u.$$
Reduction paths can have different lengths. If we take
another  path  that
has length $m'$ and  uses
$\, x^{u_{\nu_j}} \rightarrow  z_{\nu_j} \cdot x^{v_{\nu_j}} \,$
at the $j$-th step, then the output would be
$$ \, z_{\nu_1} z_{\nu_2} z_{\nu_3} \cdots z_{\nu_{m'}} \cdot x^u  .$$

\begin{theorem} \label{paths}
The ideal $J_M$ of local equations
on $Hilb_A$ is generated by the binomials
$$ \, z_{\mu_1} z_{\mu_2} z_{\mu_3} \cdots z_{\mu_m} - 
z_{\nu_1} z_{\nu_2} z_{\nu_3} \cdots z_{\nu_{m'}} $$ each encoding a
pair of distinct reduction sequences from a feasible solution of an
integer program of the type (\ref{IP}) to the corresponding optimal
solution using the minimal test set in (\ref{GrobnerBasis}).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The given ideal is contained in $J_M$ because its generators
are differences of monomials arising from the possible
reduction paths of $\,{lcm(x^{u_i},x^{u_j})} $,
for $1 \leq i,j \leq r $. Conversely, any reduction
sequence can be transformed into an equivalent reduction sequence
using S-pair reductions. This follows from standard
arguments in the proof of Buchberger's criterion
\cite[\S 2.6, Theorem 6]{HS:CLO}, and it implies that
the binomials  $ \, z_{\mu_1}  \cdots z_{\mu_m} -
 z_{\nu_1}  \cdots z_{\nu_{m'}}  \,$ are $\k[z]$-linear
combinations of the generators of $J_M$.
\qed
\end{proof}

A given feasible solution of an integer program (\ref{IP})
usually has many different reduction paths to the optimal solution
using  the reduced Gr\"obner basis (\ref{GrobnerBasis}). 
For our matrix \ref{OurMatrix} and cost vector 
$w = (9,3,5,0,0)$, the monomial
$\, a^2 b d e^6 \,$  encodes the feasible solution $(2,1,0,1,6)$
of the integer program 
$$ {\rm Minimize} \quad
w \cdot u \,\,\quad
{\rm subject} \,\, {\rm to } \,\,\,
A \cdot u = \binom{10}{56}   \,\,\, {\rm and}
 \,\,\,u \in \N^5.$$
There are $19$ different paths from this feasible solution 
to the optimal solution $(0,3,0,3,4)$ encoded by the monomial 
$\, b^3 d^3 e^4 $. The generating function for these paths is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
& z_1^2 + 3 z_1 z_2^2 z_5 z_7 + 2 z_1 z_2 z_5 z_7^2 z_{12}
 + 2 z_1 z_2 z_5 z_8 \\ & {} + 2 z_1 z_2 z_{12} z_{13} + z_1 z_5 z_9 
 + z_2^3 z_4 z_5 z_7^2 + z_2^3 z_4 z_{13} + z_2^3 z_5 z_{11} \\ & {} 
 + 2 z_2 z_3 z_5 z_7 + z_3 z_5 z_7^2 z_{12} + z_3 z_5 z_8 + z_3 z_{12} z_{13}.
\end{eqnarray*}
The difference of any two monomials in this generating function 
is a valid local equation for the toric Hilbert scheme of
(\ref{OurMatrix}). For instance, the binomial 
$\,  z_3 z_5 z_7^2 z_{12} - z_3 z_{12} z_{13} \,$ lies in $J_M$,
and, conversely, $J_M$ is generated by binomials obtained in this manner.

The scheme structure of $J_M$ encodes obstructions to making certain
reductions when solving our family of integer programs. For instance,
the variable $z_3$ is a zero-divisor modulo $J_M$. If we factor it
out from the binomial $\,  z_3 z_5 z_7^2 z_{12} - z_3 z_{12} z_{13}
\in J_M \,$, we get 
$\, z_5 z_7^2 z_{12} - z_{12} z_{13} \,$,
which does not lie in $J_M$. Thus there is no monomial
$a^{i_1} b^{i_2} c^{i_3} d^{i_4} e^{i_5} \,$
for which both the paths $ z_5 z_7^2 z_{12} $ and
$ z_{12} z_{13} $ are used to reach the optimum.
It would be a worthwhile combinatorial project to
study the path generating functions and their relation
to the ideal $J_M$ in more detail.

It is instructive to note that the binomials
$ \, z_{\mu_1} z_{\mu_2} \cdots z_{\mu_m} \, - \,
 z_{\nu_1} z_{\nu_2}  \cdots z_{\nu_{m'}}  $
in Theorem~\ref{paths} do not form a vector space basis
for the ideal $J_M$. We demonstrate this for the lexicographic
Gr\"obner basis (with $a \succ b \succ c \succ d \succ e$) of 
the toric ideal defining the rational normal curve of degree $4$. 
In this case, we can take $A = \left ( \begin{array}{ccccc}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \end{array} \right )$ and the 
universal family in question is :
$$ 
\bigl\{
a c    - z_1 b^2, \,
a d    - z_2 b c,\,
a e    - z_3 c^2,\,
b d    - z_4 c^2,\,
b e    - z_5 c d,\,
c e    - z_6 d^2
\bigr\}.
$$ 
The corresponding ideal of local equations is
$J_M = 
\langle z_3 - z_2  z_5, z_2 - z_1  z_4, z_5  - z_4 z_6 \rangle $,
from which we see that $M$ is a smooth point of $Hilb_A$.
The binomial $\,z_1 z_5 - z_1 z_4 z_6 \,$ lies in $J_M$
but there is no monomial that has the reduction path $z_1 z_5$
or $z_5 z_1 $ to optimality.  Indeed, any monomial
that admits the reductions $z_1 z_5$ or $z_5 z_1$ must be
divisible by either $\, a c e \, $ or $\, a b e  $.
The path generating functions for these two monomials are
$$ abe \quad \rightarrow \quad
(z_3 \, + \, z_1 z_4 z_5 \, +\, z_2 z_5) \cdot b c^2 $$
$$ ace \quad \rightarrow \quad
(z_3 \,+ \,z_1 z_4 z_5 \,+\,
z_2 z_4 z_6) \cdot c^3 . $$
Thus every reduction to optimality using $z_1$ and $z_5$ must
also use $z_4$, and we conclude that $\,z_1 z_5 - z_1 z_4 z_6 \,$
is not in the $\k$-span of the binomials listed in
Theorem~\ref{paths}.

\section{The Coherent Component of the Toric Hilbert Scheme}

In this section we study the component of the toric Hilbert scheme
$Hilb_A$ that contains the point corresponding to the toric ideal
$I_A$. An $A$-graded ideal is
coherent if and only if it is isomorphic to an initial ideal of $I_A$
under the action of the torus $(\k^\ast)^n$. All coherent $A$-graded
ideals lie on the same component of $Hilb_A$ as $I_A$.
We will show that this component need not be
normal, and we will describe how its local and global equations can be
computed using \Mtwo.  Every term order for the toric ideal $I_A$ can
be realized by a weight vector that is an element in the lattice $\,N
= Hom_\ZZ( ker_\ZZ(A) , \ZZ) \, \simeq \, \ZZ^{n-d}$.  Two weight
vectors $w$ and $w'$ in $N$ are considered {\it equivalent}\index{weight vectors!equivalent} if they
define the same initial ideal $\,in_w(I_A) = in_{w'}(I_A)$.  These
equivalence classes are the relatively open cones of a projective fan
$\Sigma_A$ called the {\em Gr\"obner fan\index{Grobner fan@Gr\"obner fan}} of $I_A$  
\cite{HS:MR}, \cite{HS:ST}. This fan lies in 
$\mathbb R^{n-d}$, the real vector space spanned by the lattice $N$.

\begin{theorem}
The toric ideal $I_A$ lies on a unique irreducible component of
the toric Hilbert scheme $Hilb_A$, called the coherent component.
The normalization of the coherent
component is the projective toric variety defined by 
the Gr\"obner fan of $I_A$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The {\it \ie{divisor at infinity}} on the toric Hilbert scheme $Hilb_A$ 
consists of all points at which at least one of the local coordinates
(around some monomial $A$-graded ideal) is zero.  This is a proper
closed codimension one subscheme of $Hilb_A$, parametrizing
all those $A$-graded ideals that contain at least one monomial.  
The complement of the divisor at infinity in 
$Hilb_A$ consists of precisely  the orbit of $I_A$ 
under the action of the torus $(\k^*)^n $.
This is the content of \cite[Lemma 10.12]{HS:St2}.

The closure of the $(\k^*)^n $-orbit of $I_A$ is a
reduced and irreducible component of  $Hilb_A$.
It is reduced because $I_A$ is a smooth point on $Hilb_A$,
as can be seen from the local equations, and it is irreducible
since $(\k^*)^n$ is a connected group. It is a component
of $Hilb_A$ because its complement lies in a divisor.
We call this irreducible component the
{\it \ie{coherent component}} of $Hilb_A$.

Identifying $(\k^*)^n$ with $Hom_\ZZ(\ZZ^n, \k^*)$, we note
that the stabilizer of $I_A$ consists of those linear forms
$w$ that restrict to zero on the kernel of $A$. Therefore
the coherent component is the closure in $Hilb_A$
of the  orbit of the point $I_A$ under the action of the torus
$\, N \otimes \k^* \, = \,Hom_\ZZ( ker_\ZZ(A), \k^*)$.
The $(N \otimes \k^*)$-fixed points
on this component are precisely the coherent monomial 
$A$-graded ideals, and the same holds for the
toric variety of the Gr\"obner fan. 

Fix a maximal cone $\sigma$ in the Gr\"obner fan $\Sigma_A$,
and let $M = \langle x^{u_1}, \ldots, x^{u_r} \rangle$ 
be the corresponding (monomial) 
initial ideal of $I_A$.  As before we write
$$ \left \{ x^{u_1} -  z_1 \cdot x^{v_1} \,, \,\,
 x^{u_2} - z_2  \cdot x^{v_2} \,,\, \, \ldots \, ,
\,\, x^{u_r} -   z_r \cdot x^{v_r} \right \}$$
for the universal family arising from the corresponding
reduced Gr\"obner basis of $I_A$.  Let $J_M$ be the
ideal in $\k [z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_r]$ defining this family.

The restriction of the coherent component to the 
affine neighborhood of $M$ on $Hilb_A$ is defined
by $\, J_M :  (z_1 z_2 \cdots z_r)^\infty $.
It then follows from our combinatorial description of
the ideal $J_M$ that this ideal quotient is a binomial prime ideal.
In fact, it is the ideal of algebraic relations among the 
Laurent monomials $\, x^{u_1- v_1}, \ldots, x^{u_r-v_r}$.
We conclude that the restriction of the coherent component to the
affine neighborhood of $M$ on $Hilb_A$ equals
\begin{equation}
\label{uv-algebra}
 {\rm Spec} \,\, \k \bigl[
 x^{u_1-v_1},
 x^{u_2-v_2},  \ldots,
 x^{u_r-v_r} 
\bigr] .
\end{equation}

The abelian group generated by the vectors
$\, u_1-v_1, \ldots, u_r-v_r \,$  equals
$\ker_\ZZ(A) = Hom_\ZZ(N,\ZZ)$. This follows from 
\cite[Lemma 12.2]{HS:St1} because the
binomials $x^{u_i} - x^{v_i}$ generate the toric ideal $I_A$.
The cone generated by the vectors $\, u_1-v_1, \ldots, u_r-v_r \,$  is
precisely the polar dual $\sigma^\vee$ to
the Gr\"obner cone $\sigma$. This follows from
 equation (2.6) in \cite{HS:St1}. We conclude that the
normalization of the affine variety
(\ref{uv-algebra}) is the normal affine toric variety
\begin{equation}
\label{normal-uv-algebra}
 {\rm Spec} \,\, \k \bigl[
 \ker_\ZZ(A) \,\cap\, \sigma^\vee \bigr] .
\end{equation}

The normalization morphism from (\ref{normal-uv-algebra}) to
(\ref{uv-algebra}) maps the identity point in the  toric variety
 (\ref{normal-uv-algebra}) 
to the point $I_A$ in the affine chart 
(\ref{uv-algebra}) of the toric Hilbert 
scheme $Hilb_A$. 
Clearly, this normalization morphism is equivariant with respect to the
action by the torus $\, N \otimes \k^* $.
These two properties  hold for every maximal cone $\sigma$ of the 
Gr\"obner fan $\Sigma_A$. Hence there exists a unique 
$\, N \otimes \k^* $-equivariant morphism $\phi$
from the projective toric variety associated with $\Sigma_A$
onto the coherent component of $Hilb_A$, such that $\phi$ maps 
the identity point to the point $I_A$ on $Hilb_A$, and 
$\phi$ restricts to the normalization
morphism (\ref{normal-uv-algebra}) $\rightarrow$ (\ref{uv-algebra}) on each
affine open chart. We conclude that $\phi$
is the desired normalization map from the
projective toric variety associated with the Gr\"obner fan of $I_A$ 
onto the coherent component of the toric Hilbert scheme $Hilb_A$.
\qed
\end{proof}

We now present an example that shows that the coherent component 
of $Hilb_A$ need not be normal. This example is 
derived from the matrix that appears in Example 3.15 of \cite{HS:HM}.
This example is also mentioned in \cite{HS:PS1} without details.
Let $d=4$ and $n=7$ and fix the matrix

\begin{equation}
\label{non-normal}
A = \left( \begin{array}{ccccccc}  
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 6 & 7 & 5 & 8 & 4 & 3 \\
3 & 7 & 2 & 0 & 7 & 6 & 1 \\
6 & 5 & 2 & 6 & 5 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right).
\end{equation}

The lattice $\,N =  Hom_\ZZ ( ker_\ZZ(A), \ZZ)$
is three-dimensional. The toric ideal $I_A$ is minimally 
generated by $30$ binomials of total degree between $6$ and $93$.

<<<A = {{1,1,1,1,1,1,1},{0,6,7,5,8,4,3},{3,7,2,0,7,6,1},
   {6,5,2,6,5,0,0}};>>>
<<<IA = toricIdeal A>>>

We fix the weight vector $w = (0,0,276,220,0,0,215)$ in $N$ and 
compute the initial ideal $M = in_w(I_A)$. This initial ideal 
has $44$ minimal generators.

<<<Y = QQ[a..g, MonomialSize => 16,
           Weights => {0,0,276,220,0,0,215},
           Degrees =>transpose A];>>>
<<<IA = substitute(IA,Y);>>>
<<<M = ideal leadTerm IA>>>

\begin{proposition} The three dimensional affine variety
  (\ref{uv-algebra}), for the initial ideal $M$ with respect to $w =
  (0,0,276,220,0,0,215)$ of the toric ideal of $A$ in
  (\ref{non-normal}), is not normal.
\end{proposition} 

\begin{proof}
The universal family for the toric Hilbert scheme $Hilb_A$ at $M$ is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\{& a^2e^{15}g^{18}-z_1b^3c^6d^{10}f^{16}, \,\,
b^{13}d^{15}f^{16}-z_2a^8ce^{21}g^{14}, \\ &
c^{59} d^{57} f^{110} - z_3  e^{92} g^{134},
a c^{14} d^{11} f^{23} - z_4  b e^{19} g^{29}, \\ &
b^7 c^2 g^4 - z_5  d^4 e^3 f^6, \,\,
\ldots, \,\,
b c^{34} d^{32} f^{62} - z_{44}  e^{53} g^{76} \}.
\end{eqnarray*}
The semigroup algebra in (\ref{uv-algebra})
is generated by $44$ Laurent  monomials 
gotten from this family. It turns out that the
first four monomials suffice to generate the semigroup.
In other words, for all $j \in \{5,6,\ldots,44\}$
there exist
$ i_1,i_2,i_3, i_4 \in \N $ such that
$\,
z_{j} - 
z_1^{i_1}
z_2^{i_2}
z_3^{i_3}
z_4^{i_4} \in  J_M : (z_1 \cdots z_{44})^\infty $.
Hence the semigroup algebra in (\ref{uv-algebra}) is:
$$ \k \bigl[
 \frac{a^2 e^{15} g^{18}}{ b^3 c^6 d^{10} f^{16}}, 
 \frac{ b^{13} d^{15} f^{16} }{a^8 c e^{21} g^{14}},
 \frac{ c^{59} d^{57} f^{110}} {e^{92} g^{134}}, 
 \frac{ a c^{14} d^{11} f^{23}} {b e^{19} g^{29}}
\bigr] \,\,\, \simeq \,\,\,
\frac{\k[z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4]}{\langle z_1^5  z_2 z_3 - z_4^2 \rangle}.
$$
This algebra is not integrally closed, since
a toric hypersurface is normal if and only if
at least one of the two monomials in the defining equation 
is square-free. Its integral closure 
in $\k[ ker_\ZZ(A) ]$ is generated by the
Laurent monomial
\begin{equation}
\label{witness}
\frac{z_4}{z_1^2} \,\, = \,\, 
( z_1 z_2 z_3)^{\frac{1}{2}}  \,\, = \,\, 
\frac{ b^5 c^{26} d^{31} f^{55}}{a^3 e^{49} g^{65}}.
\end{equation}
Hence the affine chart (\ref{normal-uv-algebra}) of the toric variety
of the Gr\"obner fan of $I_A$ is the spectrum of the normal domain
$  \k[z_1,z_2,z_3,y]/ \langle
z_1  z_2 z_3 - y^2 \rangle$, 
where $y$ maps to (\ref{witness}).
\qed
\end{proof}

We now examine the local equations of $Hilb_A$ about $M$ for this 
example.
<<<JM = localCoherentEquations(IA)>>>
<<<G = removeRedundantVariables JM;>>>
<<<toString ideal gens gb(G JM)>>>

This ideal has six generators and decomposing it 
%%% $\langle z_32z_42^2z_44-z_37^2z_42,
%%% z_32^3z_35z_37^2-z_42^2z_44,

%%% z_35z_37^8z_42-z_42^6z_44^4 \rangle$
we see that there are five components 
through the monomial ideal $M$ on this toric Hilbert scheme. They 
are defined by the ideals: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\langle z_{32}z_{42}z_{44}-z_{37}^2,z_{32}^4z_{35}-z_{42},
z_{32}^3z_{35}z_{37}^2-z_{42}^2z_{44},
z_{32}^2z_{35}z_{37}^4-z_{42}^3z_{44}^2,\\
\indent \indent z_{32}z_{35}z_{37}^6-z_{42}^4z_{44}^3,
z_{35}z_{37}^8-z_{42}^5z_{44}^4 \rangle$ 
\item $\langle z_{44},z_{37} \rangle$
\item $\langle z_{37},z_{42}^2 \rangle$
\item $\langle z_{42},z_{35} \rangle$ 
\item $\langle z_{42},z_{32}^3 \rangle$.
\end{itemize}
All five components are three
dimensional. The first component is an affine patch of the coherent
component and two of the components are not reduced. Let $K$ be the 
first of these ideals.

<<<K = ideal(z_32*z_42*z_44-z_37^2,z_32^4*z_35-z_42,
    z_32^3*z_35*z_37^2-z_42^2*z_44,z_32^2*z_35*z_37^4-z_42^3*z_44^2,
    z_32*z_35*z_37^6-z_42^4*z_44^3,z_35*z_37^8-z_42^5*z_44^4);>>>

Applying {\tt removeRedundantVariables} to $K$ we see that 
the affine patch of the coherent component is, locally at $M$,
a non-normal hypersurface singularity (agreeing with (\ref{witness})).
The labels on the variables depend on the order of elements in 
the initial ideal $M$ computed by \Mtwo in line {\tt i61}.

There is a general algorithm due to de Jong \cite{HS:DJ} for 
computing the \ie{normalization} of any affine variety. 
In the toric case, the problem of normalization amounts to  
computing the minimal {\em \ie{Hilbert basis}} of a given convex
rational polyhedral cone \cite{HS:Sch}. An efficient implementation can be 
found in the software package {\tt Normaliz}\indexcmd{Normaliz} by Bruns and
Koch \cite{HS:BK}.

Our computational study of the toric Hilbert scheme in this
chapter was based on local equations rather than
global equations (arising from a projective embedding of  $Hilb_A$),
because the latter system of equations tends to be too large 
for most purposes. Nonetheless, they are interesting.
In the remainder of this section, we present a canonical 
projective embedding of the coherent component of $Hilb_A$.

Let $G_1, G_2, G_3, \ldots, G_s$ denote all the {\it Graver fibers} of
the matrix $A$. In Section 1 we showed how to compute them in 
{\sl Macaulay 2}. Each
set $G_i$ consists of the monomials in $\k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ 
that have a fixed Graver degree.  Consider the set $\, {\mathbf G} \,
:= \, G_1 G_2 G_3 \cdots G_s \,$ that consists of all monomials that
are products of monomials, one from each of the distinct Graver
fibers. Let $t$ denote the cardinality of ${\mathbf G}$.  We introduce
an extra indeterminate $z$, and we consider the $\N$-graded semigroup
algebra $\,\k[z {\mathbf G}] $, which is a subalgebra of
$\k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,z]$. The grading of this algebra is $\,deg(z) = 1\,$ and
$\, deg(x_i) = 0$. Labeling the elements of ${\mathbf G}$ with
indeterminates $y_i$, we can write
$$ \k[z {\mathbf G}]   = 
\k[y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_t]/P_A, $$
where $P_A$ is a homogeneous toric ideal
associated with a configuration of $t$ vectors in $\ZZ^{n+1}$.
We note that the torus $(\k^*)^n$ acts naturally on 
$\, \k[z {\mathbf G}]$.

\begin{example} \rm
Let $n=4,d=2$ and 
 $\, A \, = \, \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
3 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 
 \end{array} \right) $,
so that $I_A$ is the ideal of the twisted cubic curve.
There are five Graver fibers:

<<<A = {{1,1,1,1},{0,1,2,3}};>>>
<<<I = toricIdeal A;>>>
<<<Graver = graver I;>>>
<<<fibers = graverFibers Graver;>>>
<<<peek fibers>>>

The set ${\mathbf G} = G_1 G_2 G_3 G_4 G_5 \,$ consists of
$22$ monomials of degree $14$.

<<<G = trim product(values fibers, ideal)>>>
<<<numgens G>>>

We introduce a polynomial ring in $22$ variables
$y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_{22}$, and we compute the ideal $P_A$.
It is generated by $180$ binomial quadrics. 

<<<z = symbol z;>>>
<<<S = QQ[a,b,c,d,z];>>>
<<<zG = z ** substitute(gens G, S);>>>
<<<R = QQ[y_1 .. y_22];>>>
<<<F = map(S,R,zG)>>>
<<<PA = trim ker F>>>

These equations define a toric surface
of degree $30$ in projective $21$-space.
<<<codim PA>>>
<<<degree PA>>>

The surface is smooth, but there are too many equations and the
codimension is too large to use the Jacobian criterion for smoothness
\cite[\S 16.6]{HS:Eis} directly. Instead we check smoothness for each
open set $y_i \neq 0$. 

<<<Aff = apply(1..22, v -> (
                       K = substitute(PA,y_v => 1);
                       FF = removeRedundantVariables K;
                       ideal gens gb (FF K)));>>>
<<<scan(Aff, i -> print toString i);>>>

By examining these local equations, we see that $Hilb_A$ is smooth, and also
that there are eight fixed points under the
action of the $2$-dimensional torus. They correspond
to the variables $y_1,y_2,y_3,y_6,y_{11},y_{15},y_{20}$ and $y_{22}$. 
By setting any of these eight variables to $1$ in the
$180$ quadrics above, we obtain an affine variety
isomorphic to the affine plane.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem} \label{isomorphism}
The coherent component of the toric Hilbert scheme $Hilb_A$ is
isomorphic to the projective spectrum $\,Proj \,\k[z {\mathbf G}]\,$
of the algebra $\k[z {\mathbf G}]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} The first
step is to define a morphism from $\,Hilb_A \,$ to
the $(t-1)$-dimensional projective space
$\P({\mathbf G}) = Proj \, \k[y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_t]$.
Consider any point $I$ on $Hilb_A$. We intersect
the ideal $I$ with the finite-dimensional vector space
$\k G_i$, consisting of all homogeneous polynomials
in $\k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ that lie in the $i$-th  Graver degree.
The definition of $A$-graded ideal implies that
$I \cap \k G_i$ is a linear subspace of codimension $1$ in $\k G_i$.
We represent this subspace by an equation
$\, g_i(I) = \sum_{u \in G_i } c_u x^u \,$, which is 
unique up to scaling. Taking the product of these
polynomials for $i=1,\ldots,t$, we get a unique (up to scaling)
polynomial that is supported on ${\mathbf G} = G_1 G_2 \cdots G_t$.
The map $\, I \mapsto g_1(I) g_2(I) \cdots g_t(I)\,$
defines a morphism from $Hilb_A \,$ to $\P({\mathbf G})$.
This morphism is equivariant with respect to the  $(\k^*)^n$-action
on both schemes.

Consider the restriction of this equivariant
 morphism to the coherent component of the toric Hilbert scheme.
It maps the $(\k^*)^n$-orbit of the toric ideal $I_A$
into the subvariety $\,Proj \,\k[z {\mathbf G}]\,$
of $\P({\mathbf G})$. This inclusion
is an isomorphism onto the dense torus, 
as the dimension of the Newton polytope of 
$$ g(I_A) = \prod_{i=1}^t \,(\sum_{u \in G_i }  x^u \,) $$
equals the dimension of the kernel of $A$. Equivalently,
the stabilizer of $g(I_A)$ in $(\k^*)^n$ 
consists only of those one-parameter subgroups
$w$ that restrict to zero on the kernel of $A$.

To show that our morphism is an isomorphism between the coherent component
and  $\,Proj \,\k[z {\mathbf G}]$,
we consider the affine chart around an initial monomial ideal
$M = in_w(I_A)$. The polynomial $g(M)$ is a monomial,
namely, it is the product of all standard monomials whose
degree is a  Graver degree. Moreover, $g(M)$ is the leading monomial
of $g(I_A)$ with respect to the weight vector $w$. The Newton
polytope of $g(I_A)$ is the Minkowski sum of the Newton polytopes 
of the polynomials $\,g_1(I_A),   \ldots, g_t(I_A)$,
and it is a state polytope for $I_A$, by \cite[Theorem 7.5]{HS:St2}.

Let $g(M) = x^q$, and let  $\sigma$  be the cone of the
Gr\"obner fan  $\Sigma_A$ that has $w$ in its interior. 
Then  $\sigma$ coincides with the normal cone at the vertex $q$ of 
the state  polytope described above  \cite[\S 3]{HS:St2}.
Consider the restriction of our morphism to the affine chart around $M$
of the coherent component,  as described in (\ref{uv-algebra}).
This restriction defines an isomorphism onto the variety
\begin{equation}
\label{other-uv-algebra}
Spec \,\,  \k[\, x^{p-q} \, : \,x^p \in {\mathbf G} \, ]
\end{equation}
On the other hand, the semigroup algebra in (\ref{other-uv-algebra})
is isomorphic to that in  (\ref{uv-algebra}) because
each pair of vectors $\{u_i, v_i\}$ seen in the 
reduced Gr\"obner basis lies in one of the Graver fibers $G_j$.  
Hence our morphism restricts to an isomorphism from the
affine chart around $M$ of the coherent component onto (\ref{other-uv-algebra}).
Finally, note that (\ref{other-uv-algebra}) is the principal affine
open subset of $\,Proj \,\k[z {\mathbf G}]\,$ defined by the
coordinate $x^q$. Hence we get an isomorphism between the
coherent component of $Hilb_A$ and $\,Proj \,\k[z {\mathbf G}]$.
\qed
\end{proof}

\section{Fourier-Motzkin Elimination}\index{Fourier-Motzkin elimination}\label{FMe}

We now give the \Mtwo code for converting the generator/inequality
representation of a rational convex polyhedron to the other. It is
based on the Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure for eliminating a
variable from a system of inequalities \cite {HS:Zie}. This code was
written by Greg Smith.

Given any cone $C \subset \R^d$, the polar cone of $C$ is defined to be
$$C^{\vee} = \{ x \in \R^d \mid x \cdot y \leq 0, \mbox{for all\ } y
\in C\}.$$

\noindent For a $d \times n$ matrix $Z$, define
$cone(Z) = \{ Z x \mid x \in \R_{\geq 0}^n \} \subset \R^d,$ and 
$\mathit{affine}(Z) = \{ Z x \mid x \in \R^n \} \subset \R^d.$
For two integer matrices $Z$ and $H$, both having  $d$
rows, {\tt polarCone(Z,H)} returns a list of two integer matrices
{\tt\char`\{A,E\char`\}} such that $$cone(Z) + \mathit{affine}(H) = \{ x \in \R^d \mid A^t
x \leq 0, E^t x = 0\}.$$ 
Equivalently, $(cone(Z) + \mathit{affine}(H))^\vee = cone(A) + \mathit{affine}(E).$

We now describe each routine in the package {\tt polarCone.m2}\indexcmd{polarCone.m2}.  We have
simplified the code for readability, sometimes at the cost of efficiency.
We start with three simple subroutines: {\tt primitive}, {\tt toZZ}, and {\tt
rotateMatrix}. 

\medskip
The routine {\tt primitive} takes a list of integers {\tt L}, and divides
each element of this list by their greatest common denominator.

<<<code primitive>>>

\medskip
The routine {\tt toZZ} converts a list of rational numbers to a list of 
integers, by multiplying by their common denominator.
<<<code toZZ>>>

\medskip
The routine {\tt rotateMatrix} is a kind of transpose.  Its input is a
matrix, and its output is a matrix of the same shape as the transpose.
It places the matrix in the form so that in the routine {\tt polarCone},
computing a Gr\"obner basis will do the Gaussian elimination that is needed.
<<<code rotateMatrix>>>

\medskip
The procedure of Fourier-Motzkin elimination as presented by 
Ziegler in \cite{HS:Zie} is used, together with some heuristics that he
presents as exercises.  The following, which is a kind of $S$-pair
criterion for inequalities, comes from Exercise 2.15(i) in \cite{HS:Zie}.

The routine {\tt isRedundant} determines if a row vector (inequality)
is redundant. Its input argument {\tt V} is the same input that is
used in {\tt fourierMotzkin}: it is a list of sets of integers.  Each
entry contains indices of the original rays that do {\sl not} vanish
at the corresponding row vector.  {\tt vert} is a set of integers; the
original rays for the row vector in question.  A boolean value is
returned.  

<<<code isRedundant>>>

\medskip
The main work horse of {\tt polarCone.m2} is the subroutine 
{\tt fourierMotzkin}, which eliminates the first variable in the
inequalities {\tt A} using the double description version of
Fourier-Motzkin elimination. The set {\tt A} is a list of lists of
integers, each entry corresponding to a row vector in the system of
inequalities.  The argument {\tt V} is a list of sets of integers.
Each entry contains the indices of the original rays that do {\sl
  not} vanish at the corresponding row vector in {\tt A}.  Note that
this set is the {\sl complement} of the set $V_i$ appearing in
exercise 2.15 in \cite{HS:Zie}. The argument {\tt spot} is the integer
index of the variable being eliminated.  

The routine returns a list {\tt \char`\{projA,projV\char`\}} where {\tt projA} is
a list of lists of integers.  Each entry corresponds to a row vector
in the projected system of inequalities.  The list {\tt projV} is a
list of sets of integers.  Each entry contains indices of the original
rays that do {\sl not} vanish at the corresponding row vector in {\tt
  projA}. 

<<<code fourierMotzkin>>>

\medskip
As mentioned above, {\tt polarCone} takes two matrices {\tt Z, H},
both having $d$ rows, and outputs a pair of matrices {\tt A, E} 
such that $(\operatorname{cone}(Z) + \operatorname{affine}(H))^\vee =
\operatorname{cone}(A) + \operatorname{affine}(E).$

<<<code(polarCone,Matrix,Matrix)>>>

If the input matrix $H$ has no columns, it can be omitted.  A sequence of two
matrices is returned, as above.
<<<code(polarCone,Matrix)>>>

As a simple example, consider the permutahedron in $\R^3$ 
whose vertices are the following six points. 

<<<H = transpose matrix{
{1,2,3},
{1,3,2},
{2,1,3},
{2,3,1},
{3,1,2},
{3,2,1}};>>>

The inequality representation of the permutahedron is obtained 
by calling {\tt polarCone} on $H$: the facet normals of the 
polytope are the columns of the matrix in the first argument of the 
output. The second argument is trivial since our input is a polytope 
and hence there are is no non-trivial affine space contained in it.
If we call {\tt polarCone} on the output, we will get back H as
expected. 

<<<P = polarCone H>>>
<<<Q = polarCone P_0>>> 

\section{Minimal Presentation of Rings}\label{Mpor}

Throughout this chapter, we have used on several occasions the simple, yet
useful subroutine {\tt removeRedundantVariables}.
In this appendix, we present \Mtwo code for this routine,
which is the main ingredient for finding minimal
presentations of quotients of polynomial rings.
Our code for this routine is a somewhat simplified, but less
efficient version of a routine in the \Mtwo package, {\tt minPres.m2}\indexcmd{minPres.m2},
written by Amelia Taylor.

The routine {\tt removeRedundantVariables} takes as input an ideal {\tt I} in
a polynomial ring {\tt A}.  It returns a ring map {\tt F} from {\tt A} to
itself that sends redundant variables to polynomials in the non-redundant
variables and sends non-redundant variables to themselves.  For example:
  <<<A = QQ[a..e];>>>
  <<<I = ideal(a-b^2-1, b-c^2, c-d^2, a^2-e^2)>>>
  <<<F = removeRedundantVariables I>>>
The non-redundant variables are $d$ and $e$.  The image of $I$ under $F$
gives the elements in this smaller set of variables.  We take the ideal of a 
Gr\"obner basis of the image:
  <<<I1 = ideal gens gb(F I)>>>
The original ideal can be written in a cleaner way as
  <<<ideal compress (F.matrix - vars A) + I1>>>
  
  Let us now describe the \Mtwo code.  The subroutine {\tt
    findRedundant} takes a polynomial $f$, and finds a variable $x_i$
  in the ring of $f$ such that $f = c x_i + g$ for a non-zero
  constant $c$ and a polynomial $g$ that does not involve the
  variable $x_i$.  If there is no such variable, {\tt null} is
  returned.  Otherwise, if $x_i$ is the first such variable , the list
  $\{i, c^{-1} g\}$ is returned.

<<<code findRedundant>>>

The main function {\tt removeRedundantVariables} requires an ideal in a
polynomial ring (not a quotient ring) as input.  The internal
routine {\tt findnext} finds the first entry of the (one row) matrix {\tt M}
that contains a redundancy.  This redundancy is used to modify the list {\tt
xmap}, which contains the images of the redundant variables.
The matrix {\tt M}, and the list {\tt xmap} are both updated, and 
then we continue to look for more redundancies.

<<<code removeRedundantVariables>>>
