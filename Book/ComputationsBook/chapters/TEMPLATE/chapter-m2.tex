\section*{Introduction}
Here we would write the introduction.  See the next chapter for more detailed instructions.

Here we could write some interesting math.  We could even index things like
$H^2(X,\mathbf O_X)$\index{$H^i$} with math.

\section{Some interesting computations}
Here we could write some interesting computations.

\subsection{A subsection title}  This is a subsection.

\subsubsection{A subsubsection title}  This is a subsubsection.

\section{Yet more stuff}
For some reason {\tt bibtex} gets upset if we don't have at least one
citation in the paper \cite{MR47:3318}.
