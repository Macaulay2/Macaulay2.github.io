The Macaulay2 free software project ( <a href="http://macaulay2.com/">http://macaulay2.com/</a> ) seeks one or
more part-time programmers.  Macaulay2 is a free software computer algebra
system designed for research in mathematics and related fields.  It contains
its own high-level interpreted user language, and the program is written in a
combination of C and C++, another language that we created to help write the
interpreter that gets translated into C, and the user language.  Macaulay2
depends on a number of other free software libraries.

</p>
<p>

This is a temporary position funded by an NSF contract that terminates in
August, 2015, but other funding may be available after that.  Applications
received by Friday, November 18, 2011 will receive full consideration.

</p>
<p>

The candidate will be expected to set and manage his/her own development and
delivery schedules with minimal supervision.

</p>
<p>

To apply, send email to Mike Stillman (<a href="mailto:mike@math.cornell.edu">mike@math.cornell.edu</a>), with "M2
Programmer" in the subject line.  Pay will be competitive, and will depend on
experience.

</p>
<p>

There are several projects available, and there will be others in the future.
An applicant may be suitable for all, or for only one.

<h3>1. Release Manager: prepare releases for Macaulay2, and maintain the web site and wiki</h3>


  The preparation of releases includes the following duties:

  <ul>
    <li>
    a. prepare binary releases, for Mac OS X, various versions of
         Unix, GNU-Linux, freeBSD, and Windows under Cygwin
    </li>
    <li>
    b. make sure that these ports pass the test suite
    </li>
    <li>
    c. place them on our web site
    </li>
    <li>
    d. submit releases to Ubuntu, Gentoo, and other distributions
    </li>
    <li>
    e. contact Macaulay2 authors to solicit packages they have written
         to be distributed with M2
    </li>
  </ul>

  The successful applicant will be familiar with building software under
  GNU-Linux and Mac OS X, will be familiar with autoconf, make, sh, gdb, and
  related tools, and will have experience with the errors that arise when
  porting software to new platforms or operating systems.

</p>
<p>

  Note: our build system currently builds to many major systems.
    
<h3>2. Project: Port Macaulay2 to (native) Windows</h3>

  Currently, Macaulay2 runs on Windows under Cygwin, and many variants of Unix,
  GNU-Linux, and Mac OS X.  The applicant will port Macaulay2, and the software
  that it depends on, to Windows by compiling it either with Visual C/C++, or
  with GNU's MINGW, whichever seems most appropriate.

</p>
<p>

  The successful applicant will be familiar with programming in C and C++ on
  Windows, and with porting Unix software to Windows.

</p>
<p>

  Something will have to be done about Macaulay2's top-level function "fork"
  and its use by at least one package.

<h3>3. Project: Multicore and multithreaded Macaulay2</h3>

  We have recently added multithreaded support to Macaulay2.  Currently, this
  support is very basic.  The applicant will extend its capabilities and make
  the multithreaded base reliable and efficient.

</p>
<p>

  The successful applicant will be familiar with programming for multiple
  cores, in C and C++ under GNU-Linux and Mac OS X, including debugging such
  programs.  It will be necessary to know or be able to learn quickly the
  Macaulay2 user language.

<h3>4. Project: improve the TeXmacs interface</h3>

 TeXmacs is a free visual mathematics and scientific text editor that supports
 interaction with computer algebra systems, including Macaulay2, and is
 available at <a href="http://www.texmacs.org/">http://www.texmacs.org/</a>.  
 A screen shot including an interaction
 with Macaulay2 is at <a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/Screenshots/">http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/Screenshots/</a>.  The
 applicant will improve the interface between TeXmacs and Macaulay2.  Much of
 that will involve designing good visual displays of various types of Macaulay2
 objects in the TeXmacs environment.

</p>
<p>

 The successful applicant will be expert at programming in C++ and to know or
 to be able to learn quickly the internals of both TeXmacs and Macaulay2.

The <a href="http://macaulay2.com/"><i>Macaulay2</i></a> free software project
seeks a part-time programmer to work on the flint library, see 
<a href="http://flintlib.org/">http://flintlib.org/</a>.

</p>
<p>

<i>Macaulay2</i> is a free software computer algebra system designed for
research in mathematics and related fields.  It contains its own high-level
interpreted user language, and the program is written in a combination of C and
C++, another language that we created to help write the interpreter that gets
translated into C, and the user language.  <i>Macaulay2</i> depends on a number
of other free software libraries.

</p>
<p>

As a future project, the developers of <i>Macaulay2</i> aim at relying on the
C-library Flint for univariate polynomial factorization, and a number of other
fast polynomial and matrix operations.  For this, the functionality of Flint
needs to be extended.

</p>
<p>

The candidate will be expected to set and manage his/her own development and
delivery schedules, but with communication and some supervision from members of
the flint group.

</p>
<p>

Projects in this direction include:

<ul>
<li>
1) Implement the arithmetic of univariate polynomials over general Galois fields.
</li>
<li>
2) Implement algorithms for univariate polynomial factorization over general Galois fields.
</li>
<li>
3) Implement algorithms for root finding over finite prime fields.
</li>
</ul>

This is a temporary position funded by an NSF contract that terminates in
August, 2015, but other funding may be available after that.  Applications
received by Friday, July 26, 2013 will receive full consideration.

</p>
<p>

To apply, send email to Mike Stillman
(<a href="mailto:mike@math.cornell.edu">mike@math.cornell.edu</a>), with "M2
Programmer" in the subject line.  Pay will be competitive, and will depend on
experience.
