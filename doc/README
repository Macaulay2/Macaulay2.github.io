A typical command for extracting new documentation:

  tar xzf ../upload/Macaulay2-1.13-common.tar.gz

      or

  tar xzf ../Downloads/Common/Macaulay2-1.13-common.tar.gz

      and then

  chmod -R g+w Macaulay2-1.13

See ../.htaccess for some instructions about adding doc for new releases and removing doc for old releases.
We never just remove doc for old releases, we also mark it gone. NOPE, .htaccess is no longer referred to,
as nginx is the http server not.

Also fix the symbolic link in this directory.  (Is it still in use?)

Also adjust the version numbers in ../Style/trailer.html and the date of "the
current stable version" manually and then run "make" in .. to get the web pages
regenerated.

Finally, run "make mirror" in .. to propagate the changes to our mirror.
