<title>Sheafhom, programs for homological algebra and algebraic topology
</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1> Sheafhom (first Web version, May 11, 1996) </h1>

Sheafhom is a set of programs I'm developing for homological algebra
and algebraic topology.  It allows you to work with finite-dimensional
rational vector spaces, chain complexes, and their morphisms
(i.e. linear maps).  The system supports tensor products, direct sums,
and wedge products.  The main application so far is to toric
varieties: the machine can find the rational homology of (complete,
normal, possibly singular) toric varieties in any dimension, using an
algorithm of Burt Totaro (see the source code for the reference).
Applications I hope to develop in the future include
<UL>
  <LI> Finding intersection (co)homology of toric varieties.
  <LI> Finding maps on homology between toric varieties.  Finding the
      canonical intersection 
      product on (intersection) (co)homology.
  <LI> In locally symmetric spaces Gamma\G/K, where G is a Lie group
      like SL(<I>n</I>,R) and Gamma is an arithmetic subgroup,
      separating out the part of the cohomology that does not come
      from the Borel-Serre boundary, using a recent spectral sequence
      of Ash and McConnell.
  <LI> Computing Hecke operators on locally symmetric spaces, using
      techniques of Ash, of MacPherson and McConnell, or of Paul
      Gunnells.
</UL>

<P>

Here is a three-page <A HREF="shh0596.ps"> abstract about Sheafhom
</A> in Postscript.

<P>

The current version of Sheafhom is written in Lisp.  You will have to
have a Lisp interpreter or compiler on your machine (though a version
of Sheafhom without Lisp is a possibility for the future).  For now,
I've prepared two files that give examples of how to interact with
Sheafhom.  In them I've tried to explain everything you need to know,
even if you have no experience with Lisp.  The first example file
covers <A HREF="example1.txt"> homological algebra</A>, showing how to
work in Sheafhom with linear maps, chain complexes, chain maps,
wedges, tensors, and direct sums.  The second file shows you <A
HREF="toric_ex.lisp"> how to compute the rational homology of a toric
variety</A> without having to program anything.

<P>

<h2> Obtaining the Code; Installation </h2>

Feel free to download Sheafhom.  Start with the following source files:
<UL>
  <LI> <A HREF="homolalg.lisp"><code>homolalg.lisp</code></A>, which contains the
      core routines for linear algebra and homology
  <LI> <A HREF="plainzmat.lisp"><code>plainzmat.lisp</code></A>, which contains
      the foundational algorithms for integer matrices, mostly based on
      Smith normal form.
  <LI> <A HREF="sheaf.lisp"><code>sheaf.lisp</code></A>, which covers ranked posets
      and the "cellular sheaves" based on them
  <LI> <A HREF="toric0.lisp"><code>toric0.lisp</code></A>, which
      contains the main toric variety routines in their current version.
</UL>

There is quite a bit of documentation within the source code.  The
sample files will tell you how to get at some of it.

<P> <HR> <p>

If you're running Carngie Mellon University Common Lisp on a big
Sparc, you may be able to use the compiled versions directly.
<UL>
  <LI> <A HREF="homolalg.sparcf"><code>homolalg.sparcf</code></A>
  <LI> <A HREF="plainzmat.sparcf"><code>plainzmat.sparcf</code></A>
  <LI> <A HREF="sheaf.sparcf"><code>sheaf.sparcf</code></A>
  <LI> <A HREF="toric0.sparcf"><code>toric0.sparcf</code></A>
</UL>
Just type <code>(load "toric0")</code> at a Lisp prompt, and Sheafhom
should start up.  [You may get a bunch of warning messages;
unless they're "errors", they can be ignored.]

<P>

If you're not running that particular Lisp, you can just download the
source files and type <code>(load "toric0")</code> at a Lisp prompt.
All four files will load automatically.  They will be in interpreted
mode, which is slow but convenient.

<P>

To compile the code yourself, get to a Lisp prompt and give the
command <code>(compile-file "</code><i>filename</i><code>"
:error-output nil :load t)</code> for each file in turn, in the order
<code> plainzmat, homolalg, sheaf, toric0 </code>.
