Sheafhom
</h1>

<P>

Sheafhom is a set of tools for computation in the category of
combinatorial sheaves.  It is intended for research involving
complexes of sheaves and the derived category.  In principle, it can
be used for any space topologically equivalent to a ranked poset; this
includes the constructible derived category on arbitrary simplicial
complexes and regular cell complexes.

<P>

Sheafhom's main application so far is to toric varieties.  The machine
constructs the intersection cohomology complexes of sheaves (the
<i>IC</i> sheaves) on an <i>n</i>-dimensional toric variety <i>X</i>,
for any <i>n</i> and in any perversity.  By taking hypercohomology, it
finds the rational intersection cohomology (<i>IH</i>) of <i>X</i>.
This includes the ordinary cohomology <i>H</i>^* and homology
<i>H</i>_* as special cases.  It computes the canonical maps between
<i>IC</i> sheaves, and the canonical intersection pairings, as well as
the corresponding maps and pairings on <i>IH</i>; as special cases,
this includes the cup product on cohomology, and the <i>H</i>^*-module
structure (cap product) on <i>IH</i> in any perversity.

<P>

Finally, Sheafhom provides some tools (such as kernel and cokernel)
for work in the derived category.  This means working with the
<i>IC</i> and other sheaves themselves, not just their
hypercohomology.  For instance, one can do some computations in the
category of perverse sheaves on <i>X</i>.

<P>

The toric varieties should be defined over the complex numbers.  They
should be normal, but they do not need to be smooth or projective.
They do not need to be complete (though the fan for <i>X</i> should at
least be connected in codimension one).  For technical reasons, we use
rational coefficients, though most of our algorithms are defined over
the integers.

<P>

Applications I hope to develop in the future include
<UL>
  <LI> Finding the induced maps on <i>IH</i> for maps between toric
      varieties, when these are well defined.
  <LI> Computing push-forwards <i>Rf</i>_*.  Computing the direct sum
      structure provided by the Decomposition Theorem.
  <LI> Supporting arbitrary finite simplicial complexes and regular
      cell complexes.
  <LI> In locally symmetric spaces Gamma\G/K, where G is the Lie group
      SL(<I>n</I>,R) and Gamma is an arithmetic subgroup,
      separating out the part of the cohomology that does not come
      from the Borel-Serre boundary.  One should take the constant
      sheaf on the Borel-Serre compactification and push it forward to
      the well-rounded retract, using a retraction defined
      in the latest paper of Ash-McConnell. 
  <LI> Computing Hecke operators on locally symmetric spaces, using
      techniques of Ash-Rudolph, MacPherson-McConnell, Gunnells, and/or
      Gunnells-McConnell.

Barthel</A> for his support and his constructive comments about early
versions of Sheafhom.  I thank <A

both the mathematics and the programming.  <P>

<h3> Versions of Sheafhom </h3>

<P>

The present version of Sheafhom is written in <A
HREF="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/">Macaulay 2</A>.  This
provides an elegant mathematical language which is convenient for both
the programmer and the user.

<P>

The previous versions of Sheafhom were written in Common Lisp.  See
the home page of the <A
HREF="http://www.math.okstate.edu/~mmcconn/shh0498.html">most recent
Lisp version</A> for more information.

<P>

<h4> Speed and Memory </h4>

<P>

Over the years, the Lisp version of Sheafhom has become relatively
fast.  For one substantial benchmark, the four-dimensional singular
variety based on the cross polytope, the program computes the
middle-perversity <I>IH</I> Betti numbers on a SparcServer 1000 in 20
minutes.  On a Pentium running at 166 MHz with 64M of RAM, the same
computation takes about 7 minutes.

<P>

In the Lisp version, the whole Sheafhom system is compiled.  Macaulay
2, by constrast, is largely an interpreted system, and hence is
substantially slower for Sheafhom.  The four-dimensional benchmark
above takes about 6-7 hours on the SparcServer 1000, and well over
64M of memory.  Improving this performance is an ongoing project.

<P>

The Lisp version currently supports only the <i>IC</i> sheaves and
their hypercohomology, not the canonical maps and pairings.

<h3> Learning about Sheafhom </h3>

<P>

<h4> Tutorial </h4>

This <A HREF="shh0898/demo01.txt">tutorial</A> shows how to use
Sheafhom to enter fans defining toric varieties, compute <i>IC</i>
sheaves and <i>IH</i> groups, and compute the canonical maps and
intersection pairings.  It discusses operational Chow cohomology, the
lack of a ring structure on middle-perversity <i>IH</i>, and combinatorial
invariants.  There is an introduction to computing in the category of
perverse sheaves.

<P>

<h4> Index of Functions </h4>

<P>

Here is a <A HREF="shh0898/funcList.txt">list of the main
functions</A> in the Macaulay 2 version of Sheafhom.  You can learn
about function <code>suchAndSuch</code> by downloading Sheafhom and
typing<P><code>help suchAndSuch</code><P>at a Macaulay 2 prompt, or by
reading the documentation in the source code.

<P>

<HR> <P>

<h3> Obtaining the Code </h3>

<P>

<A HREF="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/">Macaulay 2</A> can be
downloaded from this Web site.  It is a free program, and is easy to
install.  The Web site provides excellent documentation.

<P>

Sheafhom is contained in the file <A HREF="shh0898/shh.m2">shh.m2</A>.
Check the date at the top of the file to see if you have the current
version.  Put this into the directory where you run Macaulay 2, and
load it by typing<P><code>load "shh.m2"</code><P>at a Macaulay 2
prompt.

<P>

you have any questions.  Or call (405) 744-8220.
