Sheafhom
</h1>

<P>

Sheafhom is a set of programs I'm developing for work in homological
algebra and algebraic topology.  It allows you to use
finite-dimensional rational vector spaces and their morphisms
(i.e. linear maps).  The system supports tensor products, direct sums,
and wedge products, as well as partially-ordered sets.  A data
structure called a <CODE>sheaf</CODE> represents sheaves (like the
intersection homology sheaves) on certain topological spaces.  This
includes the spaces given by regular cell complexes and simplicial
complexes.

<P>

The main application so far is to toric varieties.  The machine can
find the rational intersection cohomology (<i>IH</i>) of
<i>n</i>-dimensional toric varieties, for any <i>n</i> and in any
perversity.  This includes the ordinary cohomology <i>H</i>^* and
homology <i>H</i>_* as special cases.  The varieties should be defined
over the complex numbers.  They should be normal, but they do not need
to be smooth or projective.  The <i>IH</i> is computed by a direct
approach that constructs explicit cycles on the space, modeling
Deligne's construction of intersection homology.  Slight modifications
to the code allow it to compute <i>IH</I> with integer coefficients,
though this has not been put on the Web page yet.

<P>

This work has been partially supported by the National Science
Foundation (DMS-9401460 and 9704535).

<P>

Applications I hope to develop in the future include
<UL>
  <LI> Finding the canonical map between the <i>IH</i> groups for two
      different perversities on a given toric variety.
  <LI> Finding the canonical intersection product on <i>IH</I> of
      toric varieties.  This includes the cup product on cohomology.
  <LI> Finding the induced maps on <i>IH</i> for maps between toric
      varieties, when these are well defined.
  <LI> In locally symmetric spaces Gamma\G/K, where G is the Lie group
      SL(<I>n</I>,R) and Gamma is an arithmetic subgroup,
      separating out the part of the cohomology that does not come
      from the Borel-Serre boundary, using a recent spectral sequence
      of Ash and McConnell.
  <LI> Computing Hecke operators on locally symmetric spaces, using
      techniques of Ash-Rudolph, of MacPherson-McConnell, or of Paul
      Gunnells.
  <LI> Including <B>Z</B>-modules and torsion, which are currently not
      supported.
</UL>

<P>

Here is the Web page for the <A HREF="shh0596.html">first version of
Sheafhom</A>, dated May 11, 1996.  This computes the ordinary homology
of toric varieties, using an algorithm that is simpler than for
intersection homology.  The algorithm comes from a paper of <A
HREF="mailto:totaro@math.uchicago.edu">Burt Totaro</A>.  It uses a
spectral sequence that collapses at <i>E</i>^2 because of purity
conditions; in effect, it doesn't use spectral sequences at all.

<P>

The current version of Sheafhom is written in Common Lisp.  To use it,
you will have to have a Common Lisp interpreter or compiler, one which
includes CLOS (the object-oriented extension of Common Lisp).
Currently I use <A HREF="http://www.cons.org/cmucl/">Carnegie-Mellon
University Common Lisp</A> (CMU CL), a free version available for
several platforms, including Suns and Linux machines; it goes far to
help the programmer produce excellent compiled code.  Other
high-quality Common Lisps, including free demos and versions for
Windows, are available from <A HREF="http://www.franz.com">Franz</A>
or <A HREF="http://www.harlequin.com">Harlequin</A>.

<h3> Learning about Sheafhom </h3>

<h4> Mathematical Description </h4>

Here is an eight-page <A HREF="shh0797/blurb96.ps"> description of
Sheafhom in Postscript</A>.  It is out of date, since the spectral
sequences have now been replaced with complexes of flabby sheaves (see
below), but the earlier parts may still be of interest.  The <A
HREF="shh0797/blurb96.tex"> TeX version</A>, with its <A
HREF="shh0797/shh11296.eps">accompanying figure
<code>shh11296.eps</code></A>, is also available.

<h4> Tutorials </h4>

Two tutorials give examples of how to interact with Sheafhom.  I've
tried to get you started, even if you have no experience with Lisp.
The first file covers <A HREF="shh0797/example4.txt"> homological
algebra</A>, showing how to work in Sheafhom with linear maps, chain
complexes, chain maps, wedges, tensors, and direct sums.  The second
shows <A HREF="shh0498/toric_ex3i.lisp">how to compute the rational
(co)homology and intersection homology of a toric variety</A> without
having to write any programs.  You can read the tutorial files in one
window and use another to type in the commands they describe.

<h4> The Sheafhom encyclopedia </h4>

The <A HREF="shh0797/shhentmp.html">Sheafhom encyclopedia</A>
describes every class of data object in Sheafhom, as well as every
function.  It is out of date now, but may help the user get a feeling
for the program.  Click here for the <A
HREF="shh0797/shhentmp.html">postscript version</A> or <A
HREF="shh0797/shhentmp.html">Latex version</A> of the encyclopedia.

<h3> Versions of Sheafhom </h3>

<UL>
  <LI> May 11, 1996.  First version on the Web.  The
      "Totaro" version (see above).  Not compatible with the
      later versions.
  <LI> November 1996.  First version to treat <i>IH</i> of toric
      varieties in an arbitrary perversity.  Correct but slow.
  <LI> December 3, 1996.  The previous version, with improved
      documentation.
  <LI> February 6, 1997.  Here the main linear-algebra engines were
      converted to sparse matrices.  The toric variety code was improved.
  <LI> February 26, 1997.  The same as February 6, with minor
      speed-ups.
  <LI> July 4, 1997.  Orders of magnitude faster than the previous
      versions.  The implementation of sparse matrices is much more
      space-efficient; the LLL code seems to perform well.  There are
      many shortcuts in the toric variety code.
  <LI> October 1997.  Some bugs fixed, others discovered.  Added code
      to compute the cup product on ordinary cohomology.  (An
      extension of the current code to compute products in any
      perversity should be ready soon.)
  <LI> April 1998.  A major paradigm shift: spectral sequences were
      removed and replaced with complexes of flabby sheaves.  This
      puts the code in line with the literature on derived
      categories.  Not compatible with the previous versions.
  <LI> July 4, 1998.  Same as the previous version, but a lot faster.
</UL>

<h3> Speed </h3>

The toric variety code in the May 1996 (Totaro) version is quite fast.
In the last example in the tutorial, the four-dimensional singular
variety based on the cross polytope, the program finds the ordinary
homology Betti numbers in 7 seconds on a SparcServer 1000.  The
current code is slower, since its algorithm is more general.  It
computes the middle-perversity <I>IH</I> of the same variety in 20
minutes.  On a Pentium running at 166 MHz with 64M of RAM, the same
computation took about 7 minutes.

<P>

I thank <A
HREF="http://www.mathe.uni-konstanz.de/~barthel/ich.html">Gottfried
Barthel</A> for his support and his constructive comments about
earlier versions of Sheafhom.  I am grateful to <A
HREF="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~dan/">Dan Grayson</A> for helping me
find better approaches to the project, both in the mathematics and the
programming.

<HR> <P>

<h3> Obtaining the Code; Installation </h3>

Feel free to download Sheafhom.  Currently you need the following four
source files:
<UL>
  <LI> <A HREF="shh0498/csparsez.lisp"><code>csparsez.lisp</code></A>,
      which contains the foundational algorithms for
      arbitrary-precision integer matrices, based on the integer LLL
      algorithm
  <LI> <A HREF="shh0498/homolalg.lisp"><code>homolalg.lisp</code></A>,
      which contains the core routines for rational
      vector spaces, graded objects, direct sums, tensors, exterior
      powers, etc.
  <LI> <A HREF="shh0498/sheaf.lisp"><code>sheaf.lisp</code></A>,
      which covers ranked posets and the "cellular sheaves" based on them
  <LI> <A HREF="shh0498/toric3i.lisp"><code>toric3i.lisp</code></A>, which
      contains the toric variety routines.
</UL>

You can download the source files and type <code>(load
"toric3i")</code> at a Lisp prompt.  All four files will load
automatically.  They will be in interpreted mode, which is convenient
for trying out Sheafhom or for running the first tutorial.

<P>

It is better to compile the code, though, since it is very slow in
interpreted mode.  To compile it, get to a Lisp prompt and give the
command<BR> <code>(compile-file "</code><var>filename</var><code>"
:error-output nil :load t)</code><BR> for each "<var>filename</var>"
in turn, in the order <code> "csparsez", "homolalg", "sheaf",
"toric3i"</code>.  Each file may take a few minutes.  Once the code has
been compiled on your machine, you don't have to compile it again;
typing <code>(load "toric3i")</code> in a later Lisp session will bring
up the compiled version.

<P>

There is quite a bit of on-line documentation.  Typing <code>(doc
'</code><var>thing</var><code>)</code> or <code>(help
'</code><var>thing</var><code>)</code> at a Lisp prompt should tell
you about <var>thing</var>.  The same documentation can be read in the
source code.
