<p>
This is the first announcement for a Macaulay2 event preceding the SIAM
Applied Algebraic Geometry meeting (https://www.siam.org/meetings/ag17).
We are planning three full days of M2 tutorials on July 27-29 (Thu-Sat),
which will take place at Georgia Tech. These tutorials are intended to
appeal to participants with any level of prior M2 experience. The topics
will range from the basic functionality of M2 to modeling problems in
the M2 language to more specialized tutorials on algebraic statistics and
numerical algebraic geometry. We will also reserve ample time for
practice and Q&amp;A sessions.

May 15, 2017. Priority will be given to students and early career
participants.
