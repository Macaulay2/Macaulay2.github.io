Dear Macaulay 2 user,
<p>
With funding from the National Science Foundation and National Security Agency,
we are organizing a Macaulay2 workshop, from Sunday, August 5, 2012 through
Thursday, August 9, 2012 with Saturday, August 4 and Friday, August 10 serving
as the travel days.  The workshop will be at Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  Activities will start first thing Sunday morning
(possibly Saturday night).
<p>
The purpose of the workshop is to bring Macaulay2 developers together with
those who would like to share or develop their skills at writing packages for
Macaulay 2 and those interested in developing the corresponding mathematical
algorithms.  Some sample software projects that might be undertaken are visible
at <a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/dev/projects/">http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/dev/projects/</a>,
although we are also looking for participants who might have new packages
they are interested in.  Further examples of possible projects are available as
part of our past workshop topics, which can be viewed at

The new main Macaulay 2 wiki page is
at <a href="http://wiki.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2">http://wiki.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2</a>  and
a project development page is in the process of being built there.  Please take
a look and consider posting your projects on that page.
<p>
Attendance at this workshop by invitation only --- based on a brief application
--- and all who are interested are encouraged to apply. Financial support is
available for approximately 20-30 people with preference given to younger
researchers.
<p>
Also, please note that we expect to have such a workshop approximately once per
year, so you should look for future announcements as well.
<p>
If you would like to attend, please let us know as soon as possible. Everyone
interested is strongly encouraged to apply, including graduate students and
postdocs. Your application should include
<p>
<ol>
<li>
   information about what algorithms you would like to work on, and what you
   have done in the past (this is the most important piece --- please put some
   thought into this and be as specific as possible),
</li>
<li>
   a good estimate of travel expenses, and whether you would require financial
   support for housing and meals (when available), and if you will be willing
   to share a room, (rooms are in limited supply; if additional single rooms
   are available, and you want one, we may ask you to pay any additional cost).
   your current institution and rank, and if you are a graduate student, your
   advisor's name.
</li>
</ol>
   
Applications are due by Monday, April 16, 2012 and we hope to allocate funds to
participants by Tuesday, May 1, 2012.
<p>
Our organizers for this workshop are Frank Moore and Amelia Taylor.
