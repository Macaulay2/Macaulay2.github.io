<p>Dear all,</p>

<p>We are organizing a <i>Macaulay2</i> workshop, from Monday 23 May to Thursday
26 May 2016 with Sunday 22 May and Friday 27 May serving as travel
days.  Activities will start first thing Monday morning. The workshop
will be at the University of Warwick, UK.  This is the second European
<i>Macaulay2</i> workshop.</p>

<p>The purpose of the workshop is to bring <i>Macaulay2</i> developers together
with those who would like to share or develop their skills at writing
packages for <i>Macaulay2</i> and those interested in developing the
corresponding mathematical algorithms. We are interested in
participants with a broad range of experience with <i>Macaulay2</i>, from
very experienced to novices. The novices will have the opportunity to
learn about <i>Macaulay2</i> from the more experienced participants.</p>

<p>Some examples of projects from past workshops can be viewed by looking
through the <i>Macaulay2</i> wiki pages for past workshops (see
<a href="http://wiki.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/index.php?title=Macaulay2_Wiki">http://wiki.macaulay2.com/<i>Macaulay2</i>/index.php?title=<i>Macaulay2</i>_Wiki</a> ).
There is ongoing work on many of the packages described there, and we
hope that a few teams will propose new projects and work on them at
this workshop as well.</p>

<p>Support is available from the <i>Macaulay2</i> NSF grant for a small number
of US based people with experience with M2.  We also have some local
funding that can provide partial support for participants.  If you
would like to attend, please apply as soon as possible at the
following webpage: <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/nx1ZoWHHXE">http://goo.gl/forms/nx1ZoWHHXE</a>
and also register at the Warwick MRC page:
<a href="http://web.warwick.ac.uk/mrc/events.php">http://web.warwick.ac.uk/mrc/events.php</a></p>

<p>Your application should include:</p>

<p>1. information about what projects/algorithms you would like to work
on, and what you have done in the past. (This is the most important
piece --- please put some thought into this and be as specific as
possible),</p>

<p>2. whether you would require financial support for travel expenses,
and if you will be willing to share a room.</p>

<p>3. your current institution and rank, and if you are a PhD
student, your supervisor's name.</p>

<p>Applications are due by 1 April, 2016. We plan to allocate local funds
to participants shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Thomas Kahle and Diane Maclagan (the organizers)</p>
