Dear graduate students (and their advisers),
<p>
We are organizing a 3-week graduate summer program on Algebraic Geometry for
Applications that will include Macaulay2 tutorials and feature Mike Stillman as
one of the lecturers. It will take place on the Georgia Tech campus and starts
on June 18:
<a href="http://ima.umn.edu/2011-2012/PISG6.18-7.6.12">http://ima.umn.edu/2011-2012/PISG6.18-7.6.12</a>.
<p>
Topics: Polynomial Optimization and Real Algebraic Geometry, Computer
Algebra and Numerical Algebraic Geometry, and Tropical Geometry.
Prerequisites: abstract and linear algebra.
<p>
If you are interested, we ask you to fill out the form at
<a href="http://ima.umn.edu/docs/application.php?program=PISG6.18-7.6.12">http://ima.umn.edu/docs/application.php?program=PISG6.18-7.6.12</a>
Funding is available for graduate students based in the US and comes
from two different sources. If your university is in  
<a href="http://www.ima.umn.edu/pi-pc/#PI">the list of IMA
participating organizations</a>,
please ask for a nomination letter from your department.  Otherwise,
submit a short recommendation letter from your adviser along with your
application. The deadline is April 1.
