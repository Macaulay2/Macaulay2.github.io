<p>Dear <i>Macaulay2</i> User,</p>

<p>We are organizing a <i>Macaulay2</i> workshop, from Saturday May 7 to Tuesday May 10 2016 with Friday May 6 and Wednesday May 11 serving as travel days. The workshop will be at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Activities will start first thing Saturday morning (possibly Friday night).  </p>

<p>The purpose of the workshop is to bring <i>Macaulay2</i> developers together with those who would like to share or develop their skills at writing packages for <i>Macaulay2</i> and those interested in developing the corresponding mathematical algorithms. We are interested in participants with a broad range of experience with <i>Macaulay2</i>, from very experienced to novices. The novices will have the opportunity to learn about <i>Macaulay2</i> from the more experienced participants. </p>

<p>Some examples of projects from past workshops can be viewed by looking through the <i>Macaulay2</i> wiki pages for past workshops (see link at end of email.) There is ongoing work on many of the packages described there, and we hope that a few teams will propose new  projects and work on them at this workshop as well.</p>

<p>Attendance at this workshop is by invitation only --- based on a brief application --- and all who are interested are encouraged to apply. We anticipate financial support for approximately 30-35 people. We strive to include both experienced <i>Macaulay2</i> developers and people who want to gain experience in <i>Macaulay2</i> --- there is no minimum amount of
experience that is required in order to apply!</p>

<p>If you would like to attend, please apply as soon as possible at the
following webpage</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1A5imjj9YBmRO06gjiMhNDvSeW48tKB0EVdWuOP_l2vU/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1A5imjj9YBmRO06gjiMhNDvSeW48tKB0EVdWuOP_l2vU/viewform</a></p>

<p>Your application should include:</p>

<ul>

<li>information about what projects/algorithms you would like to work
on, and what you have done in the past. (This is the most important
piece --- please put some thought into this and be as specific as
possible),</li>

<li>a good estimate of travel expenses, and whether you would require
financial support for housing and meals (when available), and if you
will be willing to share a room. (Rooms may be in limited supply; if
additional single rooms are available, and you want one, we may ask
you to pay any additional cost).</li>

<li>your current institution and rank, and if you are a graduate
student, your advisor's name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications are due by 11:59pm on March 1, 2016. We plan
to allocate funds to participants shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>Please commit to being present for the entire workshop. You will need
to bring your laptop with <i>Macaulay2</i> on it to the workshop. A wiki for
the workshop will be created here:
<a href="http://wiki.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/index.php?title=Utah2016_-_Main_Page">Utah2016_-_Main_Page</a>,
including information about travel, the workshop schedule, and Salt Lake City, Utah.
</p>


<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Adam Boocher, Karl Schwede, and Amelia Taylor, the organizers</p>
