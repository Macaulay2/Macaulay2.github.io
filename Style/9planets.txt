I got the photo 9planets.gif from a JPL (part of NASA) web site.  We should
figure out who to give credit for it to.

references to this photo also occur at :

   The Images

   The images in The Nine Planets are almost all from NASA. Here is a statement from NASA (applying to some but perhaps not
   all of its images):

       No copyright is asserted for these images. If a recognizable person appears in an image, use for commercial purposes
       may infringe a right of privacy or publicity. These images may not be used to state or imply the endorsement by NASA
       or by any NASA employee of a commercial product, process or service, or used in any other manner that might
       mislead. Accordingly, it is requested that if these images are used in advertising and other commercial promotion,
       layout and copy be submitted to NASA prior to release.

       National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Houston TX 77058 

   Here's another NASA statement:

       All of the images presented on NSSDC's Photo Gallery are in the public domain. As such, they may be used for any
       purpose. NSSDC does ask, however, that you acknowledge NSSDC as the supplier of the data. In addition, where the
       source of the image (by project or as a specific person) is credited in the text, you should also acknowledge that,
       too.

   Or see NASA's copyright guidelines page.

   HST images are generally OK for non-commercial use. But see their copyright page.
