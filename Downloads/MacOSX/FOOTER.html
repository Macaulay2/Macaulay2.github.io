<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
  After downloading, mount the disk image by clicking on it in your browser or
  by double-clicking on it in a Finder window. Then drag the <tt>Macaulay2</tt>
  folder in it to somewhere else on your disk. One good location is your system
  <tt>Applications</tt> directory, at the top level on your main disk, and we
  include a convenient link to that directory within the disk image.

  Downloaded executable files are put into "quarantine" by Mac OS, so we must
  release the files from quarantine with the following command (where "1.xxx"
  is replaced by the number of the version you downloaded.
</p>
<pre>        xattr -rc /Applications/Macaulay2-1.xxx</pre>

<h2>Getting emacs</h2>

<p>
  There are various options for getting emacs, with which <i>Macaulay2</i> can be run.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use "emacs for Mac OS X", available
    at <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">http://emacsformacosx.com/</a>.
    This is a native Mac application, with support for fonts, drag and drop,
    and cut and paste.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use "aquamacs", available
    at <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">http://aquamacs.org/</a>.
    This is a native Mac application, with support for fonts, drag and drop,
    and cut and paste.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use <tt>/usr/bin/emacs</tt>: the problem with it is that it is not X aware,
    and thus must be run in a terminal window, and that is not good enough.  (Running
    it in xterm, however, will be better than running in Mac OS X Terminal.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Compile emacs yourself from the source code available
    at <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs</a>.
    You will also need to install X11, available, for example
    at <a href="https://www.xquartz.org/">https://www.xquartz.org/</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use "homebrew" to install
    emacs: <a href="http://brew.sh/">http://brew.sh/</a>.  You will also need
    to install X11.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Set up</h2>

<p>
  Now arrange for <i>Macaulay2</i> to set up your <tt>.emacs</tt> files and your command
  shell init files so that M2 will be on the path.
</p>

<p>
  The easiest way to set up these files is to do the following in a
  Terminal window (the Terminal application is found in the <tt>Utilities</tt>
  folder inside the <tt>Applications</tt> folder.  You might want to drag this
  application to your dock too).
</p>

<p>
  First run the '<tt>setup</tt>' command in <i>Macaulay2</i> this way, replacing the 
  path <tt>/Applications/Macaulay2-1.xxx</tt> appropriately:
</p>
<pre>    /Applications/Macaulay2-1.xxx/bin/M2
          setup()  -- Type these lines inside <i>Macaulay2</i>.
                   -- Answer any questions.
          exit</pre>

<p>
  After you log out and in again, your PATH will have <i>Macaulay2</i>'s bin
  directory on it.  The '<tt>setup</tt>' routine will modify (some of) your
  shell command init files (such
  as <tt>.profile</tt>, <tt>.bashrc</tt>, <tt>.login</tt>, <tt>.cshrc</tt>),
  and your <tt>.emacs</tt> file.  The existing files are backed up first.  It
  also creates files <tt>.profile-Macaulay2</tt>, <tt>.emacs-Macaulay2</tt>,
  and <tt>.login-Macaulay2</tt> in your home directory (making no backups of
  old versions), which do the actual work, including putting <tt>M2</tt> on your
  path.
</p>

<p>
  This allows you to run <i>Macaulay2</i> by typing:
</p>
<pre>      M2</pre>
<p>
  at a terminal command line, to access the info and man pages, and to
  use the <i>Macaulay2</i> emacs interface.
</p>
