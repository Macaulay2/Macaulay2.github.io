  Microsoft Windows 10 includes the "Windows Subsystem for Linux", which allows users to
  install Ubuntu Linux and to install and run <i>Macaulay 2</i> under it.  
  See <a href="https://gist.github.com/eivan/cab0b0a29eebd91d767ea6ad7448368e">Macaulay2 for 'Linux subsystem for Windows', with GUI</a>
  for details.

  See also <a href="https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/issues/391">https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/issues/391</a>, for a discussion.

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   For older versions of Microsoft Windows, one may try to install <i>Macaulay2</i> by installing "Cygwin" first (see the link below), but -->
<!--   because of a bug in Cygwin's "ld" program, the most recent version of <i>Macaulay2</i> available is old: 1.6. -->
