<h2>Downloading <i>Macaulay 2</i> for Cygwin with setup.exe</h2>

<p>
  Installation of Cygwin is done with a program called <tt>setup.exe</tt>.  You may use it to install <i>Macaulay 2</i> by telling it the
  location of our <a href="/Macaulay2/Repositories/cygwin/">cygwin repository</a>.  It will download the needed file and install any
  prerequisite packages that you haven't yet installed.  You may look in the repository to see what versions of <i>Macaulay 2</i> are
  available.
</p>

<p>
  It may happen, when you try to run <tt>setup.exe</tt>, that you get a warning that the file is from an untrusted source, and you
  are asked whether you really want to execute it.  If you got it from <tt>http://cygwin.com/</tt>, then you can trust it and execute
  it.
</p>

<p>
  Starting in 2008, it is important to start <tt>setup.exe</tt> in such a way that it does not check for a signature attached to
  our <tt>setup.ini</tt> file, since we don't know how to generate such signatures.  (If anyone knows how we should generate
  signatures, inform us!)  You must start it with <b><tt>-X</tt></b> on the command line.  One way to do that is to open up a
  "command prompt" window, change to the directory containing <tt>setup.exe</tt>, and then type <b><tt>setup -X</tt></b> to run the
  program.  (Please observe that the <b><tt>X</tt></b> is upper case; it will not work with <b><tt>x</tt></b>.)  Another way is to
  create a shortcut on your desktop to the program, to edit the command line of the shortcut (or its target, under Vista) to
  add <b><tt>-X</tt></b> to it, and then to run the shortcut.
</p>

<p>
  Here is the way to tell Cygwin's setup.exe program the location of the <i>Macaulay 2</i> repository.  (You may tell it the first time you
  use it, or any subsequent time.)  After it downloads the list of mirror sites from cygwin.com, it displays a dialogue box
  entitled <em>Choose A Download Site</em>.  Add our site to the list of available sites by
  entering
</p>
  <pre>http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/Repositories/cygwin/</pre>
<p>
  in the box labelled <em>User URL</em> and pressing
  the <em>Add</em> button.  Once our site is on the list (with only the domain name displayed, sigh) highlight a cygwin mirror site
  (if one is not already highlighted) by clicking on it, and then highlight our site by clicking on it with the left button
  while <em>holding down the control key</em>, so that now you have two sites highlighted, ours and a cygwin mirror site.  If you
  highlight both our site and your favorite mirror for the main repository, <tt>setup.exe</tt> will always be prepared to update
  software from both repositories.  <em>Warning</em>: if you highlight just our site, then packages upon which <i>Macaulay 2</i> depends may
  not be installed for you by the cygwin setup program, and our program will not run.  (The next time you run the cygwin setup
  program, simply leave these two mirror sites highlighted, and all will be well.)
</p>

<p>
  Now press the <em>Next</em> button and examine the <em>Select Packages</em> dialogue box.  The Macaulay2 package will appear in
  the <em>Math</em> category, at the beginning of the list, perhaps because its name is capitalized.  Press the spinning arrow symbol
  to select the appropriate action: <em>Install</em>.  After you press the <em>Next</em> button <i>Macaulay 2</i> will be automatically
  installed, along with the other packages it needs.
</p>

<p>
  Installing <i>Macaulay 2</i> the way described above will set all paths appropriately and make the <i>Macaulay 2</i> emacs files visible to
  emacs, so users will not have to run the "setup()" function in <i>Macaulay 2</i>.  However, if you at least run the "setupEmacs()"
  function in <i>Macaulay 2</i>, then code will be added to your emacs init file that arranges for the <em>f12</em> function key to be bound to the
  emacs "M2" function, which starts <i>Macaulay 2</i> running in an interactive emacs buffer.  One way to run the new code in your emacs
  init file is to restart emacs, after which the <em>f12</em> key in emacs should work.  If you don't run "setupEmacs()" in <i>Macaulay 2</i>, you
  can always start <i>Macaulay 2</i> in emacs with the keystrokes <tt>M-x M2</tt> in emacs.
