<p>
  Here is the source code for the libraries and programs that we link with or
  distribute with <i>Macaulay2</i>.  The standard place to put these files in
  the source distribution is in <tt>BUILD/tarfiles/</tt>, the directory
  referred to by <tt>libraries/Makefile.library.in</tt>, but this is done
  automatically by our makefiles if you enable downloads when configuring.
