<p>
  This directory is now obsolete, as tarfiles can be obtained from our
  <a href="https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/releases">github releases</a>
  web page.

</p>

<p>
  This directory contains occasional source releases.  Tarfiles available here
  may eventually be deleted, but they will not be changed; they don't have to
  be changed, because the names of the files now incorporate the git commit
  number or the subversion release number, as well as the Macaulay2 version
  number.
