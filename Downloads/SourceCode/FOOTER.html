<p>
  However, the best way to get the source code is with a client
  for <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, the source code control system we
  use.  To get (or to view) the latest version of the source code, possibly
  with bugs, visit
  <a href="https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2">https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2</a>
  and press the "ZIP" or "Clone" buttons.  Alternatively, run this command in a
  new directory:
</p>

<pre>
        git clone https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2
</pre>

<p>
  The result will be a directory named M2 containing the source code directory
  tree of <em>Macaulay2</em>, checked out from the branch called "master".
  Other branches are used for development of numbered releases (e.g.,
  "release-1.6"), and there are tags that label stable versions of those
  branches (e.g., "release-1.6-stable-20130514").

<p>
  The old way to get the source code, soon to be phased out, is with a
  client for <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">subversion</a>, the source
  code control system we use.  To get the very latest version of the source
  code, possibly with bugs, run this command in a new directory:
</p>

<pre>
	svn co -q svn://svn.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/trunk/M2
</pre>

<p>
  The result will be a directory named M2 containing the source code directory
  tree of <em>Macaulay2</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Alternatively, as we work to port the latest numbered release to various
  architectures, we will work in one of the branches listed by this command:
</p>

<pre>
	svn list svn://svn.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/release-branches
</pre>

<p>
  The changes made there will eventually be merged into the trunk.  For example,
  to get the code corresponding to version 1.2 that is most current and thus most
  likely to compile for you, run this command:
</p>

<pre>
	svn co -q svn://svn.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/release-branches/1.2
</pre>

<p>
  The resulting directory tree, 1.2, can be renamed to M2, for example.
</p>

<p>
  To see what stable (unchanging) releases there are, run this:
</p>

<pre>
	svn list svn://svn.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/stable
</pre>

<p>
  To check out one of those, do something like this:
</p>

<pre>
	svn co -q svn://svn.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/stable/2006-11-05-0.9.95
</pre>

<p>
  The resulting directory tree, 2006-11-05-0.9.95, can be renamed, to M2, for
  example.
</p>

<p>
  After getting the source code as described above, and assuming the directory
  is now named "M2", you may build <em>Macaulay2</em> from it as follows.  First do
</p>

<pre>
	 cd M2
	 make
</pre>

<p>
  That initial step will create the "configure" script.
</p>

<p>
  Then do something like
</p>

<pre>
	 cd BUILD
	 mkdir foo
	 cd foo
	 ../../configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-download
	 make
	 make install
</pre>

<p>
  to compile and install the code.  You may replace /usr/local by $HOME/local,
  for example, if you don't have root privileges.  You may replace "foo" by a
  directory anywhere, provided you adjust the path to "configure" appropriately.
</p>

<p>
  The command
</p>

<pre>
	 ../../configure --help
</pre>

<p>
  will explain the options can be passed to the configure script.
</p>

<p>
  You may refer to the file
</p>

<pre>
	 ./INSTALL
</pre>

<p>
  for some more detailed instructions about this installation.
