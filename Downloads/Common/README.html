  This directory is where we store the architecture independent files that are
  needed when you are forced to install Macaulay 2 manually.
</p>

<p>
  Starting with release 1.1, except under Macintosh OS X and Microsoft Windows
  with Cygwin, there are two files that must be downloaded, one containing the
  files needed just for your architecture, and the other containing the files
  shared in common by all distributions.  The former includes an indication of
  the architecture in its name, and the latter includes the word "common" in
  its name and is stored in this directory.  An example:
</p>

<pre>
	Macaulay2-1.2-i386-Linux.tar.gz
	Macaulay2-1.2-common.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>
  Warning: eventually we may have to subdivide this common area.  For example,
  there may be some systems where the emacs info files are deposited in
  /usr/info, and some where they are deposited in /usr/share/info.  (The latter
  is where we put them.)  We hope we don't run into incompatibilities of that
  type.
