<p>
  Thanks to <a href="mailto:rdieter@math.unl.edu">Rex A. Dieter</a>, Macaulay2 is included in the 
  <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> distribution as the package 
  <a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/Macaulay2">Macaulay2</a>,
  so the following command will install it.
</p>

<pre>
    sudo dnf install Macaulay2
</pre>

<p>
  Parenthetically, we mention that one may also download (older) *.spec files
  and resources needed to build source and binary RPM files for Macaulay 2 and
  for all the libraries it depends on from

    For now, if getting Macaulay2 from Fedora doesn't work for you, you may
    install the package files found here manually (they all have names of the
    form <b>*.rpm</b>), but starting with version 1.0, they come in pairs, one
    containing the architecture dependent files (in this directory), and one
    containing the architecture independent files and having "common" in the
    name.  The latter can be obtained in <a href="../../Common/">Common/</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are sample commands for manually installing Macaulay2 from downloaded *.rpm
    files.  (Replace "1.1" by the current version number, "i386" by your
    architecture, and "Fedora-8" by the issue.)
  </p>

  <pre>
	  sudo rpm -i -v Macaulay2-1.1-common.rpm
	  sudo rpm -i -v Macaulay2-1.1-i386-Linux-Fedora-8.rpm
  </pre>


  <p>
    Here are sample commands for manually uninstalling Macaulay2.  (Replace "1.1" by
    the current version number.)
  </p>

  <pre>
	  sudo rpm -e -v Macaulay2-1.1
	  sudo rpm -e -v Macaulay2-common-1.1
  </pre>
