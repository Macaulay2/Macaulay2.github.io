  Eventually we will arrange for automatic installation of Macaulay 2 on
  openSUSE systems, and the method will be explained here.  For now you
  may install the package files manually (they all have names of the
  form <b>*.rpm</b>).  They come in pairs, one containing the architecture
  dependent files, and one containing the architecture independent files and
  having <b>common</b> in the name.

<p>
  Here are sample commands for manually installing Macaulay2 from downloaded
  *.rpm files.  (Replace "1.4-1" by the current version number.)
</p>

<pre>
     sudo rpm -i -v Macaulay2-1.4-1.common.rpm
     sudo rpm -i -v Macaulay2-1.4-1.x86_64-Linux-openSUSE-11.3.rpm
</pre>

  Refer to <a href="../../../PublicKeys/">PublicKeys</a> for information about checking signatures.
  The rpm files themselves are signed internally.

<p>
  Here are sample commands for manually uninstalling Macaulay2.
