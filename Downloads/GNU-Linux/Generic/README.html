<p>
  This directory contains <em>generic</em> versions of Macaulay 2, which we
  have compiled for GNU/Linux so the executable program <tt>M2</tt> depends on
  as few dynamic libraries as possible, and so the libraries are relatively
  old.  We do that to make it as likely as possible that you can run it on your
  machine.
</p>

<p>
  For us to link against an old version of the standard system
  library <tt>libc.so.6</tt> is especially useful, since the program will
  refuse to run with an older one on your system.  For example, in preparing
  <i>Macaulay2</i> 1.6, we linked against libc 2.11, which was already 3 1/2
  years old.
</p>

<p>
  There are some dynamic libraries that we must nevertheless link with, such as
  libc and libncurses.  If you have versions of these on your machine are
  sufficiently different from the versions on ours, the program will not work.
  See the corresponding *-README.txt files for information about the libraries M2
  is linked against.
</p>

<p>
  The tar files come in pairs, one containing the architecture dependent files
  (in this directory), and one containing the architecture independent files
  and having "common" in the name.  The latter can be obtained
  in <a href="../../Common/">Common/</a>.  Download and untar both files in the
  same directory, such as in a new directory with a name of your choice.
  The <i>Macaulay2</i> executable is the file <tt>Macaulay2-*/bin/M2</tt>, where 
  here <tt>*</tt> denotes the version number; run it to start <i>Macaulay2</i>.
  If some of the files end up in the wrong place, there will be an error message 
  about the file <tt>setup.m2</tt> not being found.
</p>

<p>
  Further instructions about installing from tar files are in
  <a href="../InstallingFromTarFiles.txt">../InstallingFromTarFiles.txt</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Please let us know if your (modern) GNU/Linux system is incompatible with
  this distribution of Macaulay 2.
