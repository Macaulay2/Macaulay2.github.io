  <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> includes a
  <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/macaulay2/"><i>Macaulay2</i>
  package</a> in the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">Arch User
  Repository</a>, thanks to Connor Behan.

  Alternatively, you may install the tar files manually.  They come in pairs,
  one containing the architecture dependent files (in this directory), and one
  of the <a href="../../Common/">the common files</a> containing the
  architecture independent files and having "common" in the name.  Untar the
  two tar files in the same directory.
