A typical file name for an architecture dependent Macaulay 2 distribution file
looks like this:

        Macaulay2-1.2-i386-Linux-FedoraCore-1.tar.gz

whereas the architecture independent file name looks like this

        Macaulay2-1.2-common.tar.gz

Both files are needed (except under Macintosh OS X) and should be unzipped and
unpacked in the same directory.
